"I really enjoyed this place. I wish I could give it 4.5 stars, but couldn't give it 5. Had steamed vegetable dumplings, which were very good. For my entree, it was the pad kra pao. I ordered it ""Thai Hot"", but I don't think they really believed me. Good thing they brought extra hot pepper flakes. I hate to leave a Thai restaurant when my mouth isn't on fire. The dish was good, but just a bit dry. I really did enjoy it, but it couldn't earn top marks.",tensor(1),"tensor([1], device='cuda:0')"
"It's so nice to have another 24 hour diner right in my back yard and I have few complaints.  The food is diner quality, not question about it, so I'm not going to expect amazing things in that regard.  Frozen and pre-processed?  Yep, it's there.  Do I care?  Nope.  I'm here for standard American diner fare.What I'm really wowed with is the deserts and coffee.  Finally a diner in Delco that has good quality coffee, not Starbuck's good, but definetly Wawa good.  The pie and cake are out of this world!  Coconut custard and carrot cake are by far my favorite, I'm a picky foodie when it comes to deserts (having made my own out of Cooks Illustrated) and I can confidently say this is some good pie.Another bonus they have over Tom Jones is that they take a credit card.",tensor(1),"tensor([1], device='cuda:0')"

I wanted to like Izumi but didn't. The host/waiter certainly was accommodating so service was not the issue. For the price I found the portion size to be very small.  When paying $13 for a roll I expect it to be much more hearty in size than an appetizer type roll that is more like a side dish than an entree.  The sea weed salad was nasty - although I felt like the waiter prepared us for the - others must have complained. The ginger chicken took a long time to cook but I am not sure why as when it came out it was still pink.  The flavor was ok but for $21 I would have expected to get more than an appetizer size portion of chicken. It was accompanied by a risotto which was flavored as salt. The saltiness was so overpowering that you couldn't taste anything else.  As someone who lived in Japan for four years and studied the language and culture for eleven I was underwhelmed by izumi.,tensor(0),"tensor([0], device='cuda:0')"
"This is a convenience store deli, so don't expect a neat restaurant setting or drink service (that's the only reason I give 4 stars instead of 5). I've had a Cuban press one time, and a breakfast sandwich at another time. Sandwiches are prepared upon your order and I was very happy with the food. Delicious!

Decent food but have some weird priorities and service quality is quite poor. Didn't take our orders until after we sat waiting for twenty min. Food took fourth min and a gentleman sat down after us and finished his food before we even got an apology that our food would be a while. Asked for water and was ignored or forgotten twice.

"It's Firehouse. Always consistent throughout the chain. I like the subs here. My only complaint is with their ice tea. Its way too weak, always.

"Aw, man. I was hoping I'd previously posted a glowing review of RuSan's so I could prove that once upon a time, I liked it here.

I love cheap, fast food-ish, ethnic cuisine and I have lovely memories of the Ginger Simmered Beef, Fried Garlic and Bay Shrimp Salad Maki (like I said, once upon a time), but today? Lackluster is an overstatement.With each bite, I kept hoping the next would be better. But, alas. It wasn't. Why, RuSan's?

"Paragon BJJ and Kickboxing is hands-down an amazing gym. I decided that my daily routine needed a little something extra to keep me motivated, while still getting in a great workout. I looked online for kickboxing classes in Santa Barbara and stumbled upon Paragon. After reading the various Yelp reviews, I decided to sign up for an orientation class, initially for the Kickboxing program. Sean Apperson, the co-owner of the gym, quickly responded to my email and worked around my full-time job to schedule a one on one class. I then expressed through email that I was also interested in the Jiu Jitsu program at Paragon, and he was extremely open to provide an introduction to both sports.Let me start off by saying that I have no background in martial arts or wrestling. I am female who has stayed active my entire life, but starting a new sport with no previous experience can be very intimidating, especially when there are a lot of guys taking the classes. When I walked in my first day, Sean was in the midst of a training session and was rolling with a female purple belt.... it definitely intrigued me. Sean looked up from the mat and proceeded to introduce himself with a big smile on his face and right away I felt at ease. We started with an introduction class in Jiu Jitsu and my nervousness disappeared when I realized how Sean went out of his way to make sure that I was comfortable. He was extremely encouraging throughout the training, we worked on basic technique and even laughed when I made a fool of myself (which happened a lot that first day). When the introduction class was over, I was so excited that I had found a new sport and signed up to join the gym right away.After that first orientation class, I continued to attend beginner classes with nerves about how the training would go and how other athletes would perceive me. However, those nerves quickly faded after building a friendship with my fellow classmates and instructors. Everyone at the gym is extremely welcoming, approachable, and willing to work with you regardless of your level of training. 'Family' is the word that comes to mind when I think of the athletes at the gym because there is a feeling of love and respect for each other, while still pushing each other to succeed. It's a great feeling when you walk into the gym and the instructors and other athletes greet you by name and have actual conversations with you.Also, Paragon is a very clean facility. They have a huge mat space, boxing ring, weights, cardio machines.. and they have just expanded into a bigger space, which is very exciting!! The large mat space is great for the classes and the locker rooms are clean and tidy. The shower area may be nicer than my shower at home! It's open 7 days a week and they offer classes at different times throughout the day, so you can work around your schedule.I am so glad I joined Paragon BJJ and Kickboxing. Not only have I embarked on a new lifestyle, but have met an amazing group of people who are inspiring and fun to be around. I would definitely recommend Paragon to anyone, don't hesitate and sign up!",tensor(1),"tensor([0], device='cuda:0')"

I have never been to snail salon that truly pampers their customers. The have a gel mani pedi for $45 or regular polish for $35. When you walk in they great you with smiles and are very welcoming unlike some nail salons I've been to. The give heated towels for your neck and back as you sit for your pedicure. Their pedicures are the best they really take their time massaging and perfecting your feet. They even use hot wax for a freshening peel on your heels. My pedicures take about an hour on average which I like. I've been to salons in the past that rush you so much and take a total of 20 minutes. The owner ensures that this is a relaxing experience for each customer. They also give a hot stone massage on your back as you wait for your nails to dry.

We had probably 40 people in the room and we fit pretty comfortably. You have to order for the whole group (and they'll bring out the same dishes to each table) but so much food comes out and it's all pretty good so there shouldn't be an issue where someone has nothing they want to/can eat.

"I don't know this for sure, but my first impression of this place is that it is run by unscrupulous people. Come along with me, as I journey back in time -- all the way back to Wednesday...I step foot in this 7 Eleven, and the first thing I think is: this is one of the nicest looking 7 Elevens I've ever seen.

No. All I needed were a few items. First, some good old TP. And let me be perfectly clear (as clear as Barack Obama): I DON'T buy the cheapest toilet paper because I'm cheap. I buy it because I like the way the cheap stuff feels. The more like sandpaper, the better. I like to feel like its working. I don't need to or even want to feel like an angel is up there. Or some perverted freak named Scott. In any case, I got myself 4 rolls. And then I just needed one more thing - some plastic cups for a little party I'm having this weekend. I go ahead and drop my stash on the counter, begin to extract several singles from my wallet, when the cashier looks at me and says, ""24.99.""I respond, ""That's not right.""He points at a price tag on the plastic cups which reads 19.99. I begin laughing. I tell him the price is clearly wrong. He tells me he's got to talk to his manager. Meanwhile, I tell the folks behind me waiting in line that I'm just going to go run and get different plastic cups to hurry the process along. Before he got back from doing his price check, I already had another cashier ringing up my two sleeves of cups for 1.99 each. That's more like it.At around that same moment, the first cashier comes back from his consultation with his manager. He tells me that the price was, in fact, incorrect. And that the price is actually 14.99.THAT'S the unscrupulous part.CLEARLY, THAT price is also far too high. His manager did no actual price check at all. He simply told the cashier to pretend that the real price was actually 5 dollars less, thinking that I'd be stupid enough to accept this. Why, because I'm white, and you're a racially superior Indian? You think white people are stupid don't you? We'll just believe what you tell us, and fork over our money.",tensor(0),"tensor([0], device='cuda:0')"
"This place is gorgeous and quite an experience. My complaints lie more with their administrative faults and the 500 taxes they add to your bill:When I made my initial reservation, they took $300 from my account, but I understood what that was for. However, when I checked in, they charged me for both nights because the $300 I had already deposited had not ""appeared on the system."" They finally found the glitch and said they'd give the money back at checkout (which they have yet to do), and $300 is some good spending money, especially at this resort. When it came to checkout, they apply a $18/night resort fee, so...WHY is this NOT applied to the room rate in the first place?!? So if you're looking at prices, add that, plus parking ($20 self park, $28 valet A NIGHT!). Then add the additional SIX taxes per night, that average around $15 per tax. You do the math, and add that to the room rate that is advertised before deciding on an extended stay. Honestly would've been better off in a downtown hotel overlooking the city.",tensor(0),"tensor([0], device='cuda:0')"

The food was good we received a sashimi plate and was very pleased with it. My some received a burger and fries which he ate and was happy with. But my biggest complaint is the SERVICE it was horrible. I had to get my own plates, sauce bowls and napkins, they bought out two glasses but didn't bring my son one.

"I absolutely love this place. The food is superb, the wine is great, the atmosphere is cozy, but still feels trendy. I've been here several times now and each time we closed the place down. It's just a great place to sit, enjoy your meal and have a long conversation with your friends. One of my favorite dishes is the skirt steak ($17). It's a tasty, perfectly seasoned cut of meat. Just the right amount of salt and fat and lime on it. I tried the chicken empanada and the mushroom one and by far liked the chicken one better. I've also enjoyed the paella with shrimp, which I had during Devour Indy. My only complaint was that the serving was a little small for me, and I was still hungry afterwards, but the delicious chocolate flan and the churros that followed that meal remedied that problem. I would recommend this place to anyone, whether it's for a business meeting or an evening out with friends.",tensor(1),"tensor([1], device='cuda:0')"
"My friend and I visited Tampa for a concert, and about ten minutes away from the Atlanta airport he realized that he had purchased tickets for the wrong day. We had already made hotel reservations and bought the concert tickets, so he just had to pay same-day price for airfare: all in all about $800 more. ""It was totally worth it,"" he later told me, ""Because I got to have the best sandwich of my entire life.""All because we randomly picked the Bricks of Ybor from Yelp. I can't vouch for the peanut butter or meatless menu, but the meat sandwiches that we bought were absolutely phenomenal. I had the pulled pork, which was flavored with ponzu and served on Hawaiian sweet bread. It was one of the best meals I've had in a long time. We spent a few hours hanging out and drinking, during which time Brian, the owner, came out and talked to us, comped us a drink, let us try new appetizers he was developing (all for free) and generally made us feel really welcome. I kept my eyes open to the kind of crowd that came in and out of the restaurant. It seemed to draw everything from hipsters to geriatrics and strait-laced families with young kids. I think it speaks to both the diversity of the menu and the pleasant environment. We went back for drinks before and after the concert. It got very crowded but we still received excellent food, drinks and service. I give this restaurant my strongest recommendation, and it's the first place I'm going when I next visit Tampa.",tensor(1),"tensor([1], device='cuda:0')"
"Fantastic breakfast spot.  I went on two occasions and varying degrees of service both times, but both times, the food was excellent.  The first time, the line was 10 deep, and growing mostly because the counter girl was slower than molasses to enter in a order.  It might have been because she kept screwing it up:My rib eye steak and eggs some how turned into ham steak and eggs.... the hashbrowns are excellent here but when we went back on Sunday, they weren't serving hash browns, only grits.... I opted for biscuits and eggs which were fantastic as well...  Great breakfast to grease you up after a night of drinking or you just want a well grilled meal. Best practice, walk in to the back counter, order your meal and then grab a seat - no wait staff.  They offer up great bloody mary's for those in need a little hair of the dog.I say some of the talent that walked in and out of here were better than the bar scene and much funner to talk to.  Unfortunately the busers take advantage of this also and the tables suffer with plenty of dirty dishes waiting to be taken care of... even when still when your food comes out...

"We ate at three places in NOLA over 36 hours. Lunch at Muriel's ruined us for anywhere else. There was no mediocre or bad, only good and awesome. Awesome - the gumbo. Hands down, best gumbo I've tasted in years. My wife had it and it was difficult to not steal her bowl. I had the lunch special which came with the soup of the day. Today was a crab bisque. The bisque had no meat in it, but it was delicious with plenty of flavor. I had the blackened catfish. Look in the dictionary for what I had because it was textbook blackened catfish. Excellent. Served with spinach and potatoes.  The good- My daughter had the pork chop, which might have been the disappointment. The chop was flavorful, but a tad dry. That could have been avoided.  The red beans and rice it was served with was terrific.  My wife's spinach salad looked good too. We spent less here for lunch than we did for dinner at the Red Fish Grill.

I was alright with that, to me I just got lucky with a free topping, but if it had been some kind of meat I would have been pretty bummed (I'm a vegetarian).  The pizza was really tasty, Crust was a little softer then I prefer but it was real good. I will definitely order from here again, maybe not for a little while just cause it is more expensive then other places.Also delivery was fast, and the guy called me right when he got to my house.

"This is my first review so bear with me please.I am writing this review as i sit at La Va and generally speaking I am enjoying my time here. I am currently a resident of Chicago but am out in Philadelphia visiting some friends and La Va is probably cooler than any cafe I have been to thus far in Chicago, but mind you I have not been to many. The coffee is delicious and my friend informs me that the hot chocolate is just as good. I have also been told that the bagel and hummus, and croissant's are delicious. But as far as the quality of the coffee goes, I would give it two thumbs up. The ambiance is nice, there is plenty of seating and it seems that I have yet to walk into La Va without it being packed with people, which is a good and bad thing. Besides plenty of tables to sit at there are also comfy antique couches which add to the ambiance. The reason I have given La Va a four of of five is because that even though everything is delicious and the ambiance is great, it is really nothing new. It is what is to be expected from a ""coffee shop"" in a big city. Everything is in it's place; apple laptops, trendy baristas, indie rock in the background, comfy chairs and attractive pastries, but there is nothing to write home about besides it's ability to fulfill and potentially exceed one's expectations for a coffee shop.",tensor(1),"tensor([1], device='cuda:0')"
"This place has potential but feels so disorganized. A few months ago, I bought a Groupon for classes here. I called with some questions and left a message, but no one ever got back to me. The Groupon voucher said it was good for specialty or regular classes. I went on a Sunday and was told it wasn't good for Sunday classes because they are drop-in classes. Not sure how I could have known this since the voucher didn't say Sunday classes were excluded... The Groupon was expiring soon and so I really wanted to redeem the voucher, and they finally agreed to let me use it for that day. Last night I signed up and paid for zumba class this morning and dragged myself out of bed only to discover the class was cancelled because they have special workshops today. I've been assured I'll get a refund, but come on - the class should have been cancelled in the system! On the other hand...the classes are a lot of fun. I've mainly attended Peter's zumba class and love it! He is so upbeat and energetic - his class is a great way to start off my Saturday morning. I've also attended a class called Pound that uses special drumsticks, and it was a lot of fun. The prices are very reasonable as well.

"I had been debating on reviewing ML Rose.  But here we go.  I eat here at least once a week.  As with most places when it first opened it was awesome.  Great service and solid food.   Today, it's meehh, OK.   The servers seem entitled, and they are going out of their way to serve you.  I don't understand shitty service.  The food has been luke warm at best when we have gotten it the last 5 trips. Luke warm fries, and cold burgers.  Not exactly worth the 45.00 tab for two burger, fries and two beers.   They have scaled the menu back to the point it's only burgers and cold fries.   If it came out hot and fresh, it'd be the best burger bar in Nashville.   I really keep hoping that the quality will pick up, and I keep coming back.  I think I'll give to two more shots, before I call it off, and just head to 12 South Tap room.",tensor(0),"tensor([1], device='cuda:0')"
"I have been here twice now and both times have been fabulous. The first time I went was in early July with my mother.  We both had a great time and our paintings turned out great.  It was a great night with my mom.  The second time I went, my husband and I went to the Paint Your Pet event in support of the Nevada Humane Society.  We sent in pictures of our dogs a few weeks before the class and they had sketched out our pet on the canvas.  It was such a fund night and because everyone was painting something different - it was fun to walk around and look.  We will be back and I will continue to take friends and family there.",tensor(1),"tensor([1], device='cuda:0')"

"Is there actually a good place to find breakfast in Nashville? My wife and I tried two places, and they were both marginal. Prime 108 was one of them.Looking at the ratings from dinner-goes, I'm sure Prime 108 is a fine place to have a steak, but for breakfast it left a lot to be desired. Let's start with having to stand in line in the lobby for about twenty minutes while the hostess takes her sweet time escorting people to their tables, then going to chat with some of the waiters for far too long before coming back for the next guest. Mind you, that's tolerable when the restaurant is packed, but when I can clearly see that there are at least 10 empty tables from my place in line behind four other groups (with two other groups behind us), that kind of lethargy in seating guests is unacceptable.The food and service from the waiter were also nothing spectacular. Our waiter was nearly as slow as the hostess and every time he approached our table he looked like he'd rather be anywhere else than working in that restaurant. Beyond that, the quality of the food was average at best. Particularly disappointing was the tartness of the fruit in the compote. Probably should have been checked before serving it to guests.",tensor(0),"tensor([0], device='cuda:0')"

My boyfriend and I spent New Years Eve at Tzin and it was one of the best experiences we have ever had. The restaurant is small but cozy with the addition of pillows on the booth side of the tables. We were both a little apprehensive about the dinner going into it because the pre-set dinner for New Year's Eve was a little pricey ($140/person for 5 smaller courses and a bottle of wine) but it was worth every penny!

I have been a fan of Chateau La Vin for a few years. It has been fun to watch the place evolve. At first it was more of a wine store with only a few tables.

Go on in (if there's a place to sit) and find a cute upholstered chair or spot on an old leather chair, or snag a spot on a vintage velvet seat next to the window.  Share a couch or sit at the bar and enjoy all that Tippling has to offer. Overall, I like and enjoy this place, like the decor, like the drinks and like the bartenders. However, the cocktail list can get a bit pricey.  Two drinks for $34.00? What did we order? The menu is quite fancy and there are a lot of offerings.  I only threw back one egg white whiskey sour (which was delightful) so I need to be sure to come back to check out the rest of the spirits. Service took a bit of time, which was odd, since when I was here it wasn't crowded. The speakeasy feel is a bit overthrown by the open windows, well lit space and open floor plan but this isn't the 1920's/1930's- prohibition era has ended at last!

This nightclub is complete let down. The music was a train wreck. The dj would play a good song for 10 seconds then mix to another song that was completely off the wall like a train wreck. I would go to dance floor to start dancing and by the time I made it the song was changed.  I was in the club Fri and Sat night and dj played same mix. The dj acted like. he was mixing but never had his headphones on. Hey mister dj u suck learn to dj better. Here is a tip play music longer and don't change songs . Ur selection of music is good but u mixed into dumb ass off the wall. Like u would play snoopdogg for 10secs then mix to billie jean I'm not Ur lover by mj then to 50 cent  all three songs in less than a minute.   The dj ruined the club. The bartenders were great.

Sorry, but I pay almost $400 a month for health insurance already for me and my child and I don't want to pay for others.  I did request to take it off which took an additional 30 minutes!  The manager did come to the table and told us the servers are required to tell us upon seating about the surcharge and that its posted on their menus.  We were not warned ahead of time and when I asked to see the menu the manager just said he'd take it off the check.  We will not be returning.

"I fell in love with Three Muses after looking at Yelp reviews and the restaurant's website. I feel that the website led me to believe it was a more formal tablecloth kind of place and I was a bit surprised when I arrived.  I could care less about tablecloths, just a minor observation as a direct result of the website.When we arrived 20 minutes early for our 6pm Tuesday evening reservation we were greeted by the hostess and immediately informed that no matter what, there is a very strict policy that we would only have the table for 1.5 hours and that if we wanted to enjoy the music after that, we would have to go to the bar. I completely understand why this is their policy, but early on a weeknight when the restaurant is more than half empty it is a bit rude to start with the policy. Plus, what if our meal had taken longer than 1.5 hours? Are you booted to the bar for dessert?Anyway, onto the food...below is a list of the items we ordered any any commentary:-Italian baked Mac & Cheese-I LOVE every kind of cheese possibly imaginable and I was so excited for this dish. When it arrived the pasta was a little too firm and the flavor was extremely bland.  My friends and I barely ate a quarter of the dish. I would never order that again.-Seared Scallops-I didn't eat them but my friends thought they were scrumptious.-Bacon wrapped blue cheese stuffed dates-these were incredible. For three of us we got the large order and though they were amazing, I kind of wish we got the small order only because they were so rich. A good kind of rich. I would order these again.-Beer-Braised Kurobuta Pork Belly-I thought these were really bland, too. I wouldn't order them again.-Steak & Cake-I only at the steak. I was told the crab cake was amazing and one of the best my friend ever had. The steak was awesome and so tender and flavorful.-Ms. Moon's Bulgogi Rice Bowl-This item didn't seem to fit in as well with the other items on the menu but don't let it stop you. It was very very yummy and I would absolutely order it again if I went back. It was a hearty portion and the bowl was basically all but licked at the end to eat it all.-Cardamon Panna Cotta (Ponchatoula Strawberry, Pistachio Biscotti)-I am not a huge panna cotta fan but my friend is and he loved it. I thought it was pretty good when I tried it but have no frame of reference with which to provide any more feedback. -Fluffernutter Pie (Bruleed Marshmallow, Salted Peanuts)-I was intrigued by this option and ordered it. I was underwhelmed and barely at any.-Warm Chocolate Cream Cheese Brownie (Malted Vanilla Ice Cream, Cherry)-per our waitress' recommendation we substituted the vanilla ice cream for brandied butter pecan ice cream and boy was she right. This was AMAZING. I loved the ice cream the most out of all elements of the three desserts. The brownie was tasty though I am not a huge chocolate fan.The live music was nice and the atmosphere was okay.

Anyone who calls themselves a foodie should try this place.  I'm thinking they would be pleased with this place.  But, the portions were small.  And I really didn't like the interior of the restaurant.  I'm more of a booths girl.  Booths can be classy, you know?  All in all, I would say this was an interesting place and I would come back, but the dishes were too complicated for me to want to come back beyond once a year.

"I stopped going this BK and usually avoid all BK. I don't know if all BK are like this one or is this location uniquely bad. Whenever you pass by you never see many cars so you get tricked into thinking that you could get in and out fast. When they do answer to take your order, its never friendly or welcoming. Once i thought i heard someone say ""Yea, what u want"" but i will give the benefit of the doubt i miss heard. Nothing i order is complicated or special request so you would think it wouldn't take long. It seems as if they don't start until you have paid, because they ask for me to pull around. I understand if they were busy or off hours or something reasonable, but no. You can hear them holding conversations, that if were management they would be fired on the spot. You get a sense of not being welcomed as if your inconveniencing them. Then after waiting, they bring your order to your car and say nothing. No sorry for the wait, or bla bla.I have learned the hard way to not leave until you check your food to make sure its 100%. 9 out of 10 times my order is wrong in some way. Either something is missing or they ignored my request all together. You then decide is it worth the possible wait time and rude service or just take it and leave. The last time i left i swore to never go back.If someone from management reads this, if you want to know why your store is dying.

"oh.  my.  god.  i went here for south street's ""restaurant week"" (3 courses, 30$) last weekend and it was amazing.  And that should say a lot considering that a lot of restaurants use restaurant weeks to half-assedly  crank out dishes for the masses in an assembly-line manner.  But not here.every dish was excellent, and even artistic!  I had the avocado ceviche, barbacoa (perfectly cooked), and chocolate souffle cake with cajeta ice cream.  We also ordered the custom-made guacomole for the table; a server came out and made it for us right at the table. And just as swiftly as he had made it, the four of us devoured it.  SO good.  And the waitress was super-attentive and more than willing to offer recommendations.On top of everything, the place has a very cool atmosphere and is on a stretch of south street which is very pretty, especially on a temperate spring/summer night--perfect for a little post-dinner stroll or if you're en route to some bar hopping later.Try this place--you won't regret it.",tensor(1),"tensor([1], device='cuda:0')"

"I came here Saturday night with the wifey with high hopes of finding our go to sushi place. Unfortunately I think our search must continue. A deeper dive into the rating would show two and a half stars for the sushi and four and a half stars for the service. We each got the Sixers Roll and a regular roll. As much as I appreciate the roll names referencing my favorite past time (being a long suffering Philadelphia sports junkie) the flavor was just a bit underwhelming. The regular roll on the other hand was extremely fresh, the white tuna melted in my mouth and their spicy sauce was to die for. Our waitress wasn't that great and forgot our appetizers and our drink requests however each time she failed to come through for us one of the other waiters would ask us if everything was ok despite the restaurant being packed and you could tell that everyone took a lot of pride in making sure all the patrons had a good experience.

They had a selection of local microbrews (bottle, not draft) for those interested in getting a taste of Philly in beer form. Alas, I ordered my tacos, but had a little Scooby Doo moment when the arrived. Somehow the chef decided that it was okay to put such a delicate fish in premade taco shells...enough to makes this SoCal girl wince a little and question whether I should consume.

"I'm very familiar w/ all the Marathons and this is the bleakest star in their dim galaxy! The lighting always seems oddly low, not inviting and cozy, more like ""we're saving electricity"" and want to appear closed. Zero for atmosphere in the evenings... My last time there, after heading in and standing w/ my friend , front and center, waiting to be seated in the 1/4 filled restaurant, we waited easily 10-15 minutes for attention of any kind. The waiters mostly hung out by the bar and in the recesses of the restaurant, slouching and gabbing, w/ not a glance at us obviously waiting....finally, let's call him ""Mr.Hunky"", deigned to come up and and said ""Yo, what's up?"". I thought this was a restaurant, not a singles bar from the 70's?""Mr.Hunky"" had passed us a couple times previously but seemed unable to multitask and  seat us at any of the plentiful open tables, too busy to rush back and hang with his posse....I was amazed and said we were waiting to be seated (duh)....but we decided to exit and eat at Jones round the corner where they welcome diners. I've been previously underwhelmed, overall, by the food here and at other Marathons. The  new menu seems to have carved down portions on practically everything.  The burgers are the safest bet, but you may as well not bother ordering it to taste, because it's never right. They also got rid of the one thing that was superb on their menu; the Salmon Nicoise Salad. That was my only reason for going there....that and the faint hope that ""Mr Hunky"" might suddenly realize his true calling and, possibly, only talent and do a spontaneous table dance, for the very first time truly earning his dollar bills!

Sugar Rush was one of our first stops on our quest for quality cupcakes, and we were not disappointed. The service is very friendly and you can tell they take pride in their flavors and presentation. Fast forward to now: There were a few birthdays coming up in my family and after spending lots of money on Christmas gifts, I wanted to keep it simple and affordable. Sugar Rush is very close to my house, so I thought, why not get everyone some beautiful gourmet cupcakes and a nice card? Boom~ easy, awesome gift! I went in and was greeted by a nice woman who was happy to answer any questions I had. After browsing all of the flavors (There are a lot! Something for everybody!) I ended up buying all of their margarita cupcakes, because that flavor was my favorite out of all the ones I tried a few years ago. I love that they have containers for just 1 or 2 cupcakes, perfect for gifts. My family members loved their cupcakes upon seeing them and said they were delicious!

"Horrible customer service! Went into sprint explaining we didn't want a contract. Irvin assured us that they had a program that would fit what we are looking for. After having some issues with service, not receiving/sending text successfully and having the phones looked at with no success, as well as the fact you can't access data while on the phone hinders my productivity with work we opted to cancel service. We were told that with a lease all you would have to do is turn back in the phones at any time in good shape and you could cancel service. When we went to store they wanted $650 per line which totaled over $100 more than what the phone cost in order to break my ""contract"". They then said well your not on a contract you are just committed to the phone for 24 months and there is a ""option to buy fee"" you pay of you want to ""break your agreement"". I explained that isn't what was explained to us. On top of that our 3rd phone is on a totally different payment option of installments. So that is a totally separate fee for cancellation even though it's on the same family plan. These people are shady, and if you go to a corporate store they will basically call this store the red headed step child of sprint, and of course will take no accountability even though they told us our account was totally incorrect and illogical the way it was set up. So don't trust what they say they will lie just to get you to sign the contract and after 14 days you are stuck.",tensor(0),"tensor([0], device='cuda:0')"

"I stopped in here Friday evening with my boyfriend Dan. It was chilly out and we wanted something hot to warm our empty bellies. My first impression of this place was that it was oddly set up. The drink station was pushed back into a corner and the food prep area seemed bigger than it needed to be. The restaurant appeared to be very clean and the staff was friendly. We ordered two grinder combos. I had the spicy chicken and Dan had the chicken cordon bleu. Both combos came with a medium drink and a bag of chips. I think our total was around $16. After we ordered, we were told to have a seat and our food would be brought out to us. We grabbed our drinks and some chips and waited somewhere between 8-10 minutes before we received our grinders. This annoyed me a bit, but it was probably because I was so hungry. Well my annoyance quickly disappeared when I took the first bite. Our grinders were hot, the cheese was melt-y and the flavors were great. This was much better than and ""toasted"" sub at Subway or Quiznos. I will definitely be back!",tensor(0),"tensor([1], device='cuda:0')"
It was my first time at this location but they are all pretty well the same. I usually go to a P.F. Chang's about once a year and each year it seems to get a little less impressive.

I went to El Camino on a Sunday afternoon for a late lunch. When I got there we had to wait for a table so me and my date grabbed drinks from the bar. We ordered a pitcher of margarita. The bartender came back to check on us and she couldn't hear me and flipped her head to the side and her hair landed in the pitcher. She said she was going to make another one. She pretended to throw out the liquid in the pitcher and make another one . Instead she walked over to the other bar and just added ice to the pitcher her hair landed in .That was strike one of the afternoon. Then when we were finally seated I ordered the pancho nachos with chicken. They brought it out without the chicken. I tell the waiter. Instead of bring out a fresh nacho they bring out the chicken in a bowl. Service is poor and the quality of goods is not great either. I used to like coming here but know I most likely won't be back again as the standards in customer service and quality of food and drinks has significantly decreased.,tensor(0),"tensor([0], device='cuda:0')"

"I'm laughing at all the decent reviews for this place making fun of all the low star reviewers telling us this is Kmart and not Nordstrom. First off, last time I checked, Nordstrom does not sell toilet bowl cleaner, tissue paper, laundry detergent, etc. So you should come up with a better argument. No matter which way you look at it, this Kmart is the absolute worst. They never have anything in stock, the customer service is a joke, it's filthy, it's outdated, it's overpriced for a Kmart (I can drive down to Target in Ventura and get everything at least two dollars cheaper), and filled with absolutely unnecessary things. The only reason this Kmart is the second most successful in the country is because it is the ONLY option in the Goleta/Santa Barbara area and because kids moving to isla vista who need all new furniture and supplies do not know any better when they first move to the area. No one in their right mind should give this place more than one star. I am so EMBARRASSED and DISGUSTED that this is our only option in Santa Barbara. Someone PLEASE start a petition for Target. I am begging on hands and knees.",tensor(0),"tensor([0], device='cuda:0')"

But he fixed that on his end in minutes.I highly recommend gassing up right before you check back in.  I did it the day before, but I was three gallons short and the lady was going to charge me $9 or so per gallon.

You get a chance to check out their large vats where the beer is aged, followed by an explanation of how they make their beer. You then get to go to canning, where you can see just how ridiculously fast beer is bottled and canned.

"We were led here by the glowing Yelp reviews and the fact that we had a wonderful meal at Mad Fish last year (owned by the same person as 1200). What a mistake.First off the place is tiny and extremely loud.  I ordered the sea bass, but they were out of it - at 7pm?  Next I tried to order the grouper special - again out of it.  Richard, our waiter told me (confidentially per him) that he could give me the 8 oz lobster tail for $24 along with the mashed potato side and my choice of broccoli or asparagus.  Chose the asparagus.  ChipOrdered the Berkshire pork chop with a pepper rub, mashed potatoes and asparagus.  My lobster was good, but no way was this tail 8 oz before cooking.  Chip's pork chop was a spectacle of gristle and fat.  Despite its huge size he probably got about a half portion due to the bad cut of meat.  His potatoes were pretty good. His asparagus were missing, but when he saw the sad little overcooked spears I received, he figured he'd pass.When Richard came back and asked if we wanted a box for the uneaten gristle and fat we told him it wasn't necessary and explained why.  To his credit, he apologized and removed the $15 charge for my glass of Groth Sauvignon Blanc, which we thanked him for and appreciated the gesture.When we got the bill I noticed that I was given an additional charge for the asparagus, even though that was not mentioned when he offered the choice of broccoli or asparagus.I should say that the house chopped salad, rolls and maple butter were delicious and that's what made me give 1200 two stars instead of one.Avoid at all costs.  Between the noise factor, lack of listed entrees at 7pm and the bs crap with the vegetable, there are many other places that deserve your tourist dollars more.",tensor(0),"tensor([0], device='cuda:0')"

Decor is simple, white wall with 7 frames of challenge winners and 2 laggy TVs.  The service is fine, not as personal, but nothing really to complain.  The food was the biggest difference between the places.  The pho was plain, no complexity, almost like it came from a dry seasoning pack.  They also recommended the chicken vermicelli as one of their best -- it wasn't.  First off, they call it vermicelli but they used pho noodle instead?  What!!?? It was thick, heavy, and full the stomach quick --- everything a vermicelli not suppose to be.  Anyway, we left unsatisfied.",tensor(0),"tensor([0], device='cuda:0')"
disclosure: review is for food only and not on the whiskey unfortunatelya friend took me here expressing this was the best burger in all of philly. service was efficient and there wasn't a wait at all that tuesday evening at 6pm. we were bummed they didn't have a happy hour. the burger portion was super generous and i had trouble eating it without my utensils. the quality of the ingredients was great but i still felt as if something was missing.. wish there was an extra sauce or dressing element to make it a bit juicer though the meat was far from dry. it was just missing something for me. there was a long list of add on's (at a cost) that maybe i should have splurged on? it was pretty dark in there and i was too lazy to tackle that part of the menu. i was uncomfortably full after so i'd probably share a burger if there is ever a next time.it was a decent burger but not worth any potential long wait and definitely out of my normal price range for a burger. this place left me really missing home/in n'out...,tensor(0),"tensor([0], device='cuda:0')"

It's not like I just added a sprinkling of pepper to enhance. There was absolutely no taste. What I consider an abundance of salt was added - unacceptable for a $17.50 plate of pasta.

"My family and friends came here last night for a little birthday party. The back restaurant was a tight squeeze, but made us all closer. The kids foods were huge portions compared to usual kids menu's. I got the Shrimp Fra Diablo, and as much as I don't want to say it, the food was uncomfortably spicy. A few people had a noodle or two to try and their lips, tongues and gums were on fire! I'm not sure if it's purposely that spicy or someone accidently spilled the chili oil into it. I took it home with me because for $19 I was NOT wasting it. I put some ricotta cheese in it (I did not have sour cream or lemon)and I still could barely eat it. Such a shame, it came out looking beautifully and the shrimp were huge and had the tail on (which I love, holds the flavor). The staff was quick and friendly. We will definitely be back, I just will not order the Shrimp Fra Diablo.",tensor(1),"tensor([0], device='cuda:0')"

I thought I would keep it simple with a burger and a beer. I'm always a sucker for a good burger!  I'll say that the burger meat itself was cooked to perfection (medium) with some great smokey flavor. However, the accompaniments were not so impressive. The bacon was limp, there was very little cheese, the bun was dry and crumbly, and the fries were barely warm and limp. If they had taken the time to prepare everything properly, it could have been amazing.

I felt that he took care of me during the service process and really tried his hardest to help. Manuel is extremely kind, nice and helpful. Even when I was bummed out at the dealership he is such a happy person he'd make me smile. I'm sure there are other great employees but these two really helped me out substantially.

"Just a treat to go here. A very unique dining experience. We stopped off on the way to wine tasting in Los Olivos and had a lunch. It was Sunday and they were BBQ tri-tips outside, so naturally we ordered those. I also sampled their venison chili. Both dishes were quite good. I found the venison chili a bit under developed in terms of the chili and spices, good but as if they had not had ample time to really settle in and develop. The tri-tip was excellent but the sandwich was a tad  basic and underwhelming. However the service and the setting is so fantastic and so superb, it's an old cabin that was a stop for travelers back when, that this pushed the rating to a 4.

"My fiancé and I stayed at this hotel for 3 days and 4 nights for the Epicor convention. Stunning view is an understatement. Every square inch is covered in indoor lush tropical gardens, rivers, ponds with koi, and several waterfalls. Being the incredible size it is, you must carry a map or stop at their map stations to figure out where you are. Every where you turn, is an incredible photo opportunity. This a place of intriguing explorations of multilevel curiosities. It takes a small village to keep this resort running. Truly the Disney world for adults. Staff is trained to smile and offer warm hellos as you walk by, offer professional prompt service, and jump to their feet if you say ""boo"". I don't know how the staff does it. I wouldn't be able to do it. I don't know able you, but I don't clean toilets with a peppy smile. Perhaps supergluing their faces with a permanent smile and a secret record button they press when you walk by. There are many many different bars and restaurants to choose from. Anywhere from fun casual to trendy to fine dining. The banquet food offered everyday was a hit or miss. The quality was there, especially for banquet food, but it mostly depended on your personal taste preference. We visited 2 restaurants and even room service. Each was very good and service was on par. Downside is that everything is extremely expensive. A dollar store type of cheap tre semme travel pump hairspray was almost $7. So don't forget your hairspray or deodorant people. I was already expecting inflated prices in the stores and bar because of the location, however, we almost peed our pants when we got our drink bill. $67 for 4 cheap bicardi and cokes. I'm scared what the bill would have been had we ordered a high end liquor. So back to the convention for the free drinks we went. I visited the spa. 20% gratuity was included in the bill. Which is ok. I would have tipped 18-20% anyways. The anti aging facial was more expensive than most spas, but I'd have to admit, it was worth it even tho I broke out in some kind of rash under my lower lip. I swear I'm not allergic to any products I've used before! Oh well. Nobody's fault. I would still go back. My skin felt radiant afterwards. The downside is that the resort is nowhere near downtown Nashville. The entire inside of the resort is a giant greenhouse for their incredible species of plants. So expect it to be very warm and humid. Expect to dish out a lot of money on food and drinks. I was not able to stay over the weekend, but I would have liked to seen a bit more entertainment walking the miles and miles of tropical paths. It would truly be comparable to a Disney resort, with no reason to leave, for adults if they had some kind of entertainers. They definitely have the room and atmosphere to accommodate some nightly entertainment. Perhaps some live music in one of their wonderful gazebos? Actors in costume greeting guests? So after my ridiculous blabbing, I would say that the staff is unbelievably amazing, there is no reason to leave the resort if you are staying only a few days (unless you are seeking entertainment) I don't recommend this for children. They would definitely be bored.",tensor(1),"tensor([1], device='cuda:0')"

The man at the register said him and his fiancé started this business so I wish them both luck! He was very welcoming very informative. The soft serve is so creamy-- the way it should be. The flavors are so yummy, it was nice to see familiar flavors like Ube and green tea. For some suggestions maybe a Thai tea or strawberry flavor?

"This place is versatile as anything in the Lou!  I've been here a handful of times and have always enjoyed it.  I've gone for all different types of visits.  I've gone for a late night drink and music, coffee and a study session, an evening meal, and an afternoon lunch and exploration.  This place has it all.  I have enjoyed going to do work or school work because they have bottomless coffee and free wifi.  The fact that they serve their full menu all day is nice because I can order whatever I want whenever I want.  I usually spend several hours working there and that is always nice to have.  Waitresses never seem to mind when i stay for long periods of time and spend small amounts of money.  In addition there is a lot of space to sit.  Finally, I can always go upstairs to play ping pong or shuffleboard if I need a little study break.While there menu is not huge, it has quite a bit of variety.  They offer very unique dishes, including some cool breakfast plates that are offered all day.  I must mention that everything on the menu is made in house, including their bread, meats, and sauces, which I find to be impressive.  Overall, the menu includes salads, soups, interesting appetizers, unique breakfast dishes, a variety of entree's, desserts, beers (9 oz/16 oz) and cocktails.  For the most part, everything is modestly priced.  This place continues to intrigue me because of all the different things it offers.  It has multiple levels and it triples as a restaurant, bar, music venue.  I can say I have not been there for a true concert yet, but they seem to have quite a few shows and are not usually too expensive to attend.  The 1st floor is split between the music venue and the restaurant/bar.  The 2nd floor has more open space that holds the shuffle board, ping pong table and more tables/chairs.  It also has some balcony seating for the venue side as well as another bar on this floor.  Again, I'd love to catch a show here sometime.  Overall, I think that this place is worth a visit so that you can try out the menu and explore a little bit.  It's not usually too crowded during the day and you could have free run of the place depending on when you go!",tensor(1),"tensor([1], device='cuda:0')"

"Oh Chickie's and Pete's, you are the perfect place to watch some sports and indulge. No doubt this is not the best food I've ever had but, if you can get a seat, grab some beer with mussels red and crab fries, there's no way not to thoroughly enjoy this place during a game or any time you're down by the stadiums. My favs are the crab fries, mussels red (white is overloaded with garlic that I can't always take it), the spicy pull and peel shrimp, steamers, and if the mood is right the blue crabs (it's a lot of work but tasty). This place also makes getting down and dirty with your food easy. There are sinks all over so you can rinse the mess off your hands once you're done....good touch.To sum it up, Chickie's and Pete's is a Philadelphia institution and always a good time. I strongly suggest going at least once to enjoy the experience. Please note: Make sure to remember two things before coming during major sporting events. 1. You'll never get a table and 2.

"We went here for a birthday party and had a blast.Keep in mind this isn't a typical piano bar. There is minimal seating intentionally as it has more of a bar/club feel than a lounge. The place is pretty relaxed until about 10-11pm. Then they clear out tables for a dance floor. It has a very energetic vibe.If you want seating you need to get there early, 6 or 7, and camp out. Treat your server well if you are going to kerping seats all night. Choose a table on the side or back so it doesn't get taken away later in the evening. On a Saturday there was no cover when we arrived at 8pm, making it convenient for friends who weren't with the birthday group.Now for the birthday group reservation. The package offered free entry plus a drink per person and a few other perks. It ended up being very convenient for our group as it carved out an area where we can all comfortably hang out with seats as well as mingle with friends who showed up spontaneously.

"Summary: good service, lacking amenities, had a good time, one stay is enough.First off, please don't see any of my complaints as reflecting poorly on the staff, all of which did a great job and deserve whatever employment they have. Most of the issues I had were beyond the staff's control and probably due to my own lack of research before I booked my room. That said...There wasn't any bathtub, pool, sauna, spa etc, I realize this place is less expensive than the Ritz or other nearby hotels and I didn't realize until midway through the stay how much this would affect my stay. Room service closes at 10 or 11pm, which was a disappointment, and a small room service menu. Considering the prices for breakfast items, it wasn't very impressive and nothing seemed made to order. WiFi is very unreliable, I had a corner room and never had a consistent connection for more than a few minutes at a time. The guest computers in the lobby didn't have any kind of ""user profile"" system so be aware and erase temporary internet files if you use them - when I got on the computer the previous guest's Gmail info was all right there for me to get into if I wanted. The decor looks flashy but once you poke around you realize it's all pretty cheap stuff, the dresser drawers in my room didn't close all the way, towels were scratchy and thin, carpet was old and funky etc. Also the valet charges in the neighborhood of $35 for parking, there is a 24hr parking lot with tons of space literally 100 feet away that charges about $23. Breakfast buffet is around $20 for the same cheapo continental that you would get at say a Best Western. At one point the fire alarm went off because a drunk guest went out the fire door to throw up, everyone evacuating saw this happen as they went down the stairs, but we still had to leave even though it was confirmed there was no actual fire.I would rather spend more money next time and stay somewhere with better amenities. If you want to stay somewhere cheap, stay somewhere that's actually cheap - this place was around $135 a night even with the Friends and Family discount. There are places for $70 per night that offer similar amenities.",tensor(0),"tensor([0], device='cuda:0')"

The air vents and dash area look brand new which is amazing since my car is a 1997. The rubber around the sunroof was missed and I learned the window hadn't been opened so there was no opportunity to see what needed to be cleaned there. Chips in the paint were touched up.

"This makes my 6th or 7th time to Jackson's in the last 2 years and I thought that after tonight's visit they deserved a review. I had the panini Reuben.  Panini was amazing. Great use of garlic. Loved the cut of the meat. Not stringy but nicely chinked in thin slices. Cheese was well melted throughout the mix of kraut and meat. Rye Bread was wonderful. Would love to have it as a staple in my house. Salad came out same time as sandwich which was not good.Presentation was a little sloppy. Like every other place I have had a panini (except Panera where they do it right), the sandwich was served directly on a plate. Why don't they serve on a napkin? Particularly when they bring the salad out at the same time as the sandwich?  If the sandwich sits for more than a few moments, the bread gets soggy from the steam.  Nothing serious, but for the price, which is a little high, it seems lacking.  While the price is a little high, i think it is justified considering the food and drink quality. They have a great selection of wines and beers that are likely to fit any palette.  Wait staff have always been friendly. But you can tell this is a place where people are expected to hustle. Sometimes short or even distracted the service can be lacking. The second time I visited was during a medium lunch rush and the wait time was 15 min to get drinks. My trip tonight it was about 8 min. For a sat night this is not bad. But not great either. My bartenders were awesome and never left me wanting (except for getting my salad with the main course).Overall a good experience and I will be back.",tensor(1),"tensor([0], device='cuda:0')"
"On Black Friday a few friends always get together; share food(usually leftovers) drink, jam, and whatever. After taking a walk in nearby Pennypack Park(including checking out the King's Highway Bridge), we found ourselves in Holmesburg. As it was too late to order from Jack's Place(as we usually do), & I remember bookmarking this place.We ordered a large pizza w/ grilled veg. a veggie wrap, + an order of hand-cut fries. The pizza was very good. The veggies were onions, sweet & bell peppers, broccoli and mushrooms. They were briefly sauteed on a flat-top, so I guess that technically was grilled.They were mostly in the center of the pie however. The crust was good, as was the sauce, and ample amounts of cheese made for an above average pizza. Too bad it was cold by the time we got it home, which was only a five minute drive. So were the fries. They were tasty, not overly salted nor greasy. You get a huge amount per order ($5), but were pretty much soggy because of the huge amount piled together. The garlic parm aoili was O.K., could have used more garlic.You can get these fries as poutine, or w/ other toppings for an additional $1-4.The veggie wrap was standard, but decent. All this food was just over $30, which seemed a tad high.An OK augmentation to our leftovers; I say this place has better than average pizza & fries, but is not so special as to want to return soon, or to try other stuff they serve. Definitely Jack's Place next time.",tensor(0),"tensor([0], device='cuda:0')"

"Great restaurant in a hip new hotel, it's naturally not as cheap as a chain restaurant but for a chef-driven restaurant they do a great job of creating well priced food with big flavors by typically not falling back on luxury ingredients in order to keep their food cost fairly low.  The space right off the hotel lobby is a bit strange and there's no great waiting space other than the hotel lobby but overall the decor is upscale & unique in a cool old building and the main recommendation would be to add artwork on the walls.The cocktail list is unique and an excellent complement to the food while there appear to be a number of beers and the wine list by the bottle is great but the glass pours are mostly unexciting and run from $8-12 per glass.  Clearly whoever chose the bottle list knows their stuff so hopefully they'll upgrade the glass pours over time - I'm confident there will be plenty of food & wine people here that would be willing to pay $12-15 for a nice glass of wine to go along with excellent food.Food is naturally the most important thing for most restaurants and Compere Lapin doesn't disappoint.  Our first dishes of Conch Croquettes, Smoked Drum Spread, and Broiled Shrimp in Calabrian Chili Butter were all concepted and executed just about perfectly - just be aware that the shrimp are served head-on in the shell in case you'll have issues with that but they're actually de-veined through the shell which is perfect for me.  In terms of main courses, we went with the Pici Pasta which was good but didn't quite live up to Scarpetta expectations given the slightly less than al dente pasta and small pieces of lobster that got lost in the dish's spice.  The Curried Goat with Plantain Gnocchi was excellent though and I'm sure this will be on the menu forever as a signature dish.Service was excellent (which may have been helped by our early reservation before the restaurant was full) and even the busser was great about removing our plates promptly and being very friendly despite seeming a bit limited on experience.  All around, Compere Lapin seems to be an excellent restaurant which will be around for a while and reminds me in a number of ways of Peche  regarding overall atmosphere, pricing, and food quality.  That's pretty darn good company to keep.",tensor(1),"tensor([1], device='cuda:0')"

"Absolutely terrible. We had a larger table of 8 and went on a Saturday night. The food was overpriced and not good. One in our party ordered the salmon and she asked for it to be cooked thoroughly in addition without prawns as this is an allergy. When the fish came it wasn't and it had no flavour and had the prawns. She then asked for it to be done again. They came back again with the wrong order. Then she was patient and asked they took TWO HOURS to come back out with her meal. This is not an exaggeration. In addition the server was not very understanding and did not offer her anything while she was waiting. Oh and they still made her pay full price. I used to work in the industry and when you have a screw up of that proportion, that person should not be paying for their meal. 3 other people at the table hated their meal and did not eat it. In my experience as a server and I've seen other restaurants do this, if a customer does not even touch their food, you should inquire at the very least. My meal in particular was ravioli and tasty but my goodness such a tiny portion. Wouldnt fill  up a 3 yr old. For the amount of money you pay this was a terrible experience!

"We were thoroughly impressed with this hotel! Upon arriving, you are immediately welcomed with the scent of fresh baked cookies. Walking up to the desk we were greeted by Valorie who informed us that cookies and water were complementary to guests and that we were more than welcome. Across from the desk we noticed a book shelf. This is not the kind of book shelf where rejected leftovers were placed but rather, a wide range of books by well known authors. The name of the program was called Read it and Return. In essence, you can borrow a book for the duration of your stay and if you don't finish it you can return it the next time you stay at the hotel at any of the Carlson hotels who have the same program! ( what!?! Cookies and books!?! YES!) Right off the bat, we felt like we were right at home.   Arriving at our room, we noticed that everything was extremely clean and there was a refrigerator (with a small freezer) , a microwave, a coffee maker, and a well working A.C. (you know, the kind that you don't have to yell over to have a conversation). The bathroom was stocked with brand name shampoo, conditioner, and lotion.  Our next stop was the smoking area. Normally, smokers feel as though they have been marooned to a small place behind the dumpster...but not here! Provided was 2 sets of swinging benches; set far enough away so that it did not disturb the guests in rooms around the area but no a 10 mile hike for those adults who enjoy the pleasure. Did I also mention they have smoking rooms available?In the morning, feel free to partake in a complimentary breakfast (NOT CONTINENTAL)-I mean a real breakfast which changes daily; anything from fresh made waffles to eggs, sausage, and bacon! Also, cold cereal, juices, and coffees have options! Coffee is available 24/7 as well! The hotel also has a pool and hot tub which I personally observed them clean daily!On our last night we got back late and I was going to ask the desk for a late check out, but there was no need! Their check out time is 12:00 Pm as opposed to the hotel usual of 11:00 Am. That worked out well for us.At checkout we were asked if there was anything we would change about the hotel or our stay. I made small suggestions which I thought would help them, but definitely nothing major. The desk person wrote down what I said and said she would pass it on! I was impressed with that, because we've been asked about our stay at other places, but it seemed more out of routine than actual interest. Here, she seemed genuinely interested.

"We hit Mr. B's Bistro for dinner the next night because the BBQ shrimp was supposedly the best in the area. I'm not sure if it's the cooking process (the waiter described that the shrimp were pan cooked in the BBQ sauce), but the shrimp had this really weird texture: they had no snap at all and almost a mushy texture. Normally, shrimp this large have almost a lobster texture. There was a good amount of shrimp in the dish and the bib they give you makes for a hilarious photo that I can''t post :-)We also tried the fried oysters which tasted great with the lemony sauce that was put on it.I had the braised rabbit since I hate taking shells off shrimp. This was cooked well and the sauce w/ tasso ham worked well w/ the mashed potatoes.After having dinner at Mr. B's and trying to figure out what to do for lunch on our last day, we decided to hit it for lunch on our last day. Unfortunately, it's definitely not as good as dinner. The jambalaya was ok but didn't have enough sauce. The stuffed pork chop was overcooked and oversalted and the pear stuffing didn't quite go that well with it (somewhat bitter?).  So it would have been 4 stars overall, but the lunch wasn't that great for me.Service was excellent however.",tensor(0),"tensor([1], device='cuda:0')"

"Four of us just had hibachi dinners at Megu in Cherry Hill.  Unbelievably disappointing.  For some reason the waitress just ignored the four of us.  She took orders from multiple people around us, who had come in after we sat down and started delivering food to their tables before she ever came to our section of the hibachi table or acknowledged us.  I had to get the manager to get served. The hibachi chef was one of the least skilled that I have ever seen.  One in our party ordered filet mignon.  He cooked all the dinners at our table, then after he served everyone realized that he hadn't cooked the filet, cooked it and gave it to the wrong person.  My friend didn't realize the mistake.  However, my wife pointed it out to me after we left.  Let me also mention that the place looks very worn and unkempt.  needless to say we will not be back.

Not only are the pancakes great but everything else was cooked perfectly and served with whipped butter that was probably made in heaven.

"One of the worst customer service I have ever experienced at any Toyota service center!Twice in the past half year, I have had very poor customer service here. The first time was when I bought my car in specifically asking for an inspection of my right front tire, informing them it had been leaking air a few days ago and I had to pull over to get air pumped in. They found nothing... only 2 days later, that same tire went completely flat. I took my car to a local auto shop, and they found a huge nail stuck in the tire that would've been found if Toyota had done a careful inspection the first time.Second experience was even worse and more shocking. I took my car in for servicing on a Saturday morning. The service person could not answer many of my questions, and when he stated that he was new, I kindly asked him how long he'd been working there (thinking that if he was so new that he didn't know a lot of info, that I'd ask another representative to help me). Out of nowhere, he yelled out in an extremely rude and angry manner,  ""That's none of your business ! ... I won't have you harrassing me..."" Everyone in the room was startled and turned around to see why he was shouting so loudly.  Perhaps he acted this way because there was no manager on duty, however, this behavior is customer service at its worst. As a person in the service industry myself (I am a physician and my patients' health, safety and satisfaction come first), I am shocked by his blatantly inappropriate and unacceptable behavior. This behavior reflects poorly on his company, and I hope nothing like this happens to any other customers in the future.

"This restaurant gets its name from the fresh olive bread they serve - which is wonderful! The menu is rooted in old world Mediterranean fare, but has a slight modern flair, too. The weather was wonderful, so even though the outside eating area overlooks the parking area, we opted to sit outside. The grape vines on the trellises were beautiful and healthy and just about to burst into fruit! Our entrees included the walnut encrusted trout, seafood linguine - clams, shrimp, white fish, mussels, over bed of linguine, and a lamb kofte special.  The trout was a healthy serving and perfectly prepared. Clams, mussels and shrimp over a bed of linguine was another healthy portion and half ended up in a to-go box! Again, delicious, attractively presented and perfectly prepared.  Lamb is a personal favorite, but if I had it to do over again, I would've opted for something else. It tasted ok (meat was a bit dry)  but less than appealing appearance-wise: looked like two crisscrossed sausages. It came with a very thin (runny) yogurt cucumber sauce - not the standard tzatziki one would expect. Entrees will run you about $22, pastas around $16-18, so it's not overly pricey, but the addition of a couple adult beverages or bottle of wine can change that in a heartbeat.All in all, it's a nice place with good food and attentive service.

I have not been blown away by anything, and the flavors of the dishes I have sampled (Chicken Vindaloo, Chicken Tikka Masala, Mumbia Dal, and Navratan Korma) were fairly muted.

I enjoy the richness of Indian food; if I want light, I'll get a salad or something Mediterranean. The mumbai dal (a lentil dish) was so saucy and skimpy on the lentils that it might as well have been a broth-based soup.In spite of my gripes, I do expect I will go back to Mumbai Bistro.  They fill a void for low-key, inexpensive Indian takeout in the immediate neighborhood.  They have a few tables set up to eat it, but it looks like their primary business is simple take-out.  The food (while somewhat uninspired) was all cooked well, and seemed fresh and hot in the buffet.  The space is clean, and the staff have all been friendly.

"Gizmo ' s is your typical resale booth mall that rents booth space to individuals. Gizmo's Mall doesn't seem to have as much turn-over as other mall locations. Spaces consist of used clothing, including wedding and prom dresses, jewlery, all types of home decor and collectables, vintage glassware, coin collections and antique furniture. A few booths focus on the renter's own craft projects of floral arrangements, homemade soaps, candles, aprons, wreathes, woodworking pieces and refurbished furniture. Most have a theme or similarity within their booth space but you'll run across a few that are just a hodgepodge of random items. The majority of booths are fairly well organized and clean but again, a couple have dropped the ball. If available, an employee tries to walk around checking on customers and takes any items you are carrying to the front for you. They place your items in one of the hold baskets until you're ready to check out.I'm usually on a mission searching for something fairly specific when I shop here. Occasionally I walk out without anything and other times I stumble across a great deal or unique find. The prices obviously vary greatly from booth to booth but are comparable to other booth malls.

It's getting harder and harder to find space to even sit your purse down to pay much less place your items.Worth a trip if you're in the area.

You can spend several minutes just checking out the arrangements of Mexican wrestling masks, action figures, and sombreros of many colors, along with the bold artwork.  I had the chili margarita, which was pretty much a regular margarita with chili powder on the rim and a thai red chili floating in the drink.  Only $5.50, which isn't bad.  The taste was different, but good.

The perfect combination of funny, knowledgeable, and compassionate, he made us feel like part of his family. The food was to die for. The bread was warm and fresh. The drinks were perfectly mixed. The raw oysters were fresh and succulent. I had the shrimp étouffée, which was excellent. My wife had the chicken, which was perfectly cooked and full of flavor. My children split the chicken tenders, which were obviously hand-breaded and perfectly cooked. The desserts were to die for!

I'd suggest Duling-Kurtz as a meal for a special occasion. The bread-turnovers they serve before you receive your meal are mouth watering. The turnovers are served with your choice of butter or house made lemon curd. A truly unique taste.The steak (as mentioned above) was superb. Served with a peppercorn crust and drizzle, the taste is something I'll never forget. Served with garlic, parmesan french fries (with garlic aioli) and grilled asparagus (the only entree that is served with fries ... excuse me, ""frites"".

I doubted it seriously as there is no good pizza south of North Jersey, but I tried it.  Awful is all I can say... and more awful than the regularly awful Philly style pizza.  The sauce was way too acidic.  I think they tried to compesate with sugar, but it just tasted like sweetened sauce made from rotten tomatos.  The topping look like reheated frozen nuggets of meat someone found in the back of a freezer that hadn't been cleaned out in over a year.  We have done delivery and each time it seems to get worse.  Our last deliver not only was the food boarderline ineatible, but the pizza was delivered with all the cheese piled into the corner due to the driver taking some turns a little too sharply or tilting the box on its side...

"When I was reading reviews for this joint it says for ""Just about anything..."" so I thought that they would have some sort of all day menu so they can serve just about anything at anytime of day.  It was our last day in the Clearwater Beach area and my son developed some sort or allergy from insect bites so we took him to urgent care.  As a result we did not get to Kelly's until 3:00 PM.  When they handed us this one page menu I was so surprised to see that there was not much to choose from.  I had my heart set on getting a late breakfast.  My son wanted to eat fish and they only had one fish dish on the menu :-(. I was ready to get up and leave but my husband felt bad because the server was already getting our waters.  We ordered buffalo wings, grouper sandwich, and grilled cheese.  The buffalo wings was good, the grouper sandwich was just ok, the grilled cheese was good too.  The server was really nice and gave me the option of getting both the bbq sauce and ranch dressing for the wings.

"So after coming here several times and after the thrill of the newness is over, I can review this honestly. This place is overrated. Their food is overpriced compared to other ""Healthy food"" places. Even With the sales it is sometimes not even worth it. The produce also gets old quickly and I can find the same items they carry here at publix for the same or even less. I do browse the sale options and I come sometimes for that after I compare them to other stores. The salad bar/ prepared meals are meh. Actually disappointing. I always end up driving to Whole Foods :-/ Every time I try to do my grocery shopping here I always end up having to go to other stores to find what I need for the week. I can't say that I have been able to come here and fully shop for the week and feel like I got the best deal. The only time I come here is for specific items like the enlightened ice creams because they carry almost all of the flavors. I don't hate it but it's just not the first place I would come to or think to do my full grocery shopping. The staff is really nice though.I wanted to like this place more but it just isn't doing it for me!!",tensor(0),"tensor([0], device='cuda:0')"

They even have that cool amazon locker grocery system here. I'm way too indecisive to order my groceries online, but it's a good think to keep in mind when wanting to shop here.  I can see it coming in handy if you just need to grab groceries on a jiffy. Just pay in advanced and type in your locker code. Their prices are very reasonable here for their quality of goods. I would definitely recommend this grocery store.",tensor(1),"tensor([1], device='cuda:0')"
"We've had mostly great experiences in the past here, but we went again recently and were pretty disappointed.  The waitress was aloof, slow, and not friendly at all.  When we looked at our menus, we realized they had significantly raised their prices since the last time (probably by 20-25% on the entrees).  We were unadventurous and both order the salmon with mustard butter sauce, which we've both really enjoyed in the past.  Unfortunately, my salmon was a little undercooked and my wife remarked that the salmon quality was not as good as before.  The sauce was definitely off as well--overly salty and not much of the good ground mustard flavor (I think they just went heavy on the salted butter).  The food was disappointing, especially since we were paying 20-25% more than the time before.",tensor(1),"tensor([1], device='cuda:0')"

"Had a great four-day stay here, obviously.  The Hollander may not be Hilton-perfect (there is one of those several blocks away), but it's beyond quaint - it works well.  Most importantly, it's not expensive. And it's a beautifully remodeled historic building with gorgeous hardwood floors, polished to perfection. In addition to the nicely appointed rooms, the stairwells are comfortably furnished, floored with the same gorgeous hardwood.  Which I might not have known if they did not have a slow cozy elevator.  The fun lobby hosts all sorts of entertainment from singing to trivia nights - not only free, but winners might earn some Hollander bucks. The staff, from the desk to the maids, are personable and competent. If you don't want to stroll the few blocks downtown, The Hollander offers a open-air shuttle cart to the downtown area or any nearby destination, such as Tropicana Field (and yes, also free).On Tuesday nights, the Tap Room there will pour a large frosty mug of any one of their many craft beers for only $3. And the next night you may choose a craft beer and gourmet burger for just $10. Speaking of $10, they have a chef-hosted Sunday brunch for that price, too. Beyond burgers, they have a variety of entrees, including a tasty vegetarian eggplant stack. The only negatives I can come up with are, at least while I was there, the techno-crap lobby music they played early in the evening (before the real entertainment started) was not only horrible, some of few lyrics one could hear might've been offensive to families - it was just strange and at odds with the classy BnB feel of the place.  Also, the wifi didn't work well for me, but that might've been my laptop.  Like elevators, if you're looking for luxury showers pouring out waterfalls of perfectly temp-controlled water, this might not be the place for you.  Being an older place, no central air, and that's needed in July, so the in-room units run all the time - not ideal, but they worked well and didn't bother me too much.  One lamp and a cold CFL bulb, the other a warm incandescent which I liked (not sure what to make of that mix;-).  Also, they appear to be dog friendly, as there were a few very well-behaved and nice-looking dogs in the lobby.  Even though I didn't have a dog, I liked that, but perhaps someone else wouldn't.  Oh, and there were folks smoking outside - not much one can do about that here in Florida, but fortunately they have a nice large patio area and was enough enough to find some clean breathing space.Wow, I wrote many negatives, but still feels like a 5 to me.",tensor(1),"tensor([0], device='cuda:0')"
"Went here with my husband and another couple Saturday night.  Not very busy when we walked in, but picked up shortly after.  Apparently you are not supposed to park across the street but we got away with it.  This place is cash only, and even though they've been featured on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives, there's nothing inside to suggest that Guy was ever here!  We wouldn't have gone if not for that fact (wouldn't know it existed) so maybe they should at least put up a picture of him that was taken when he visited!  They let you sample, but have a sign that tells you, ""Please know when to stop"". I wish I'd read the reviews here first, because I would've gotten a 6-for-$6 sampler!!!  They were all good flavors, there are some funky ones, for sure!  I ended up with Coffee Pecan Brittle, and everyone else got Red Velvet, except for my husband who got a scoop of Cookie Monster as well.  He thinks that he will be trying to conquer the Tchopitoulas Sundae next time we visit  (8 scoops of ice cream, 8 toppings, whipped cream, cherry) and I have no doubt he will get his name on the wall for finishing!The ice cream was very very rich and thick, and super delicious.

In addition, the potato salad that goes with hits the spot. Above all, the servers Julia and Amanda are great along with the manager Rick.  They serve the food fast and in addition, are very friendly, very personable and really go out of their way to make sure your time is enjoyable there.

No biggie since we were able to get our pass easily replaced.I would definitely consider bringing my car back here for service since the location is convenient for me and the service was great!I think the previous less-than-stellar reviews were probably due to bringing cars in during recall high season.

What we had:-Crawfish beignet: spicy with a hint of sweet, creamy (cause of the cheese), all highlighting the crawfish goodness :) I liked the marriage of flavors.-Atchafalaya pizza: topped with seafood goodies :) the crust was super thin and overall delish! the grilled garlic adds a very nice touch (I LOVE garlic).-Fried green tomato and shrimp poor boy: I'm sorry New Orleans, but after trying different poor boys from different places, I decided that I just don't like poor boys in general :(... so my opinion for this one would be very biased...Maybe it's cause at dinner time I eat really healthy most of the time (fish, or veggies, and fruits only), but I ended up with a huge tummy ache :( though I enjoyed my time here, I hate having an upset stomach after eating... or maybe it's cause I'm slightly lactose intolerant -.- oh why do I do this to myself?",tensor(1),"tensor([1], device='cuda:0')"

"Gaetano's used to be one of the better spots in the area (not saying much) to grab a good quick lunch. I'd stop in here roughly once a week to grab a sandwich off of their lunch special menu that rotated daily.Well they completely ruined that. Gone is the rotating, reasonably priced lunch menu. They've since replaced it with a menu that isn't even worth ordering off of. They regularly had specials of sandwiches, wraps, and salads on the lunch menu for under $7 that came with chips/fries and a drink. All but one item on the menu includes a drink now and I just paid $9.01 for a buffalo chicken wrap, tiny bag of chips, and soda I had to buy separately. Whoever made it must have missed the memo on how to assemble it because it didn't have the crisp lettuce and tomato inside of mine that was stated on the menu. I got a $9 wheat wrap stuffed with a pathetic amount of chicken and nothing else. It was smaller than the premade Wawa wraps. Huge change in what Gaetano's used to be, their portion sizes were always their strong point.I posted a picture a while ago of a meatball sandwich lunch special I got before they started cheaping out on their offerings. I wish I took a picture of my pathetic wrap today, they couldn't look more different. I didn't have time however because it took about 12 minutes to come out and some of us don't have all day.I'll be looking elsewhere during my lunch break.",tensor(0),"tensor([0], device='cuda:0')"
"Held a baby shower here recently for my daughter .  Marissa was very helpful in the planning and I think everyone enjoyed themselves.  We used the main dining room and bar area.  The brunch food we chose was plentiful and mostly yummy although the grits were a bit bland .  We had sampled the shrimp and grits which were very good when scouting the place but the cheesy grits I had on that dateDid not compare - however the rest of the food - including sausage , bacon , eggs and pancakes was yummy .  I wish their pastries included some kind of iced cinnamon roll mostly because that's a favorite of mine but also because it would have been more festive than the small muffins which were aBit dry - the glazed donut/ roll was good though .  The only real issue was that the drink station - serve themselves coffee and hot water in thermal vessels and juices plus champagne to make mimosas - was not out until about 30 minutes after guests arrived -- and the juice carafes were very small - almost like what you'd place on one table so kept needing refill ( I think when it appears like there is only a small amount guests will be influenced to not tAke much out of politeness so should look plentiful ) also twice when I went for coffee it was empty -- although they did refill it when asked .  The staff was very pleasant - the bartender was helpful and good about our taking up his entire bar top .  I'd highly recommend this as a party venue or just as a good brunch place",tensor(1),"tensor([0], device='cuda:0')"
"Terrible Service! I went there with a co worker around 5pm to get drinks using a giftcard I got from RiteAid.com. I've been there a couple times because their chicken fingers are delicious! When I got there, I told the bartender that I had 2 /$10 coupons(only because it didnt allow me to buy $20), she said I could only use one coupon per month. So I said 'okay well then we'll just be getting some drinks.' She never said anyrhing else. So when we get the bill, the owner came over and told me to never come back!! All because we didnt order food and he thought I was scamming him!! (If she said we had to buy food then we would have) Then said shouted that doesn't support alcoholism! (But owns a bar) I can't believe because I had 3 beers after work on a Monday, I'm considered an alcoholic! The bill was about $18 and I was going to give a good tip but.... I'm never going back.

This is one of the parks to visit when in the Tucson area and even in the winter the weather was great! It's an easy park to drive to and there's lots of parking at the visitor center.

"Pags rules this street with three separate venues: a pizza place, a fancier Italian restaurant, and the super-romantic wine bar we love.  The front room looks like an old time train station waiting area, with its dramatic hanging lights, banquettes, and tiny tables (AND the Bridgette Bardot poster).  The wine menu is heavily French and not cheap, so savor those glasses, but they will give you a taste before you invest.  For example, they had a Veuve Cliquot Yellow Label open to try by the glass ($13, and a full bottle was $84).   Most wine places don't have such an expensive bottle available for glasses.The last time we went, we were in the mood for rosé, having just accomplished one of life's milestones.  Due to excellent recommendations from the owner, we developed a major crush on Pommery champagne, which they had as splits in two different versions, pink and blue.  Oh, such a cute half-size wine bucket too.There is a full bar, not just wine, and sometimes they bring out free tapas such as kalamata olives (plus a little dish for the pits, nice touch).  We have enjoyed the arugula pizza back in our ovo-lacto days, but you don't come here for the food.  The building is long and narrow, so the back part is even darker and more intimate, if you need to hide out, and there is a tiny patio in front though I have never seen anyone on it.Music can be anything from classic jazz to electronica, and I don't remember any tvs, hurray.  Recently, Nina Simone was playing, just perfect for our mood.  My bf got into a discussion about Indian and Brazilian music with the owner, who then played some recommended Brazilian artists from his own collection for us and wrote down the names so we could hunt them down later.

"If you're in it for the scene, it doesn't get better than The French Press in SB. If you're in it for the coffee, go somewhere else.I really wanted to like this place because the vibe is awesome and I love supporting local businesses, but their drip coffee is over-roasted and WAY too bitter. Hot, iced, it doesn't matter. It's all super bitter. I wanted to like it so bad that I had one of their baristas personally french press me a 16-oz cup of coffee hand-chosen based on my desired flavor profile. It took 10-15 minutes to make and cost me $6. It was terrible. So. Effing. Bitter.To be clear, I'm specifically talking about their coffee in this review. Their lattes and cappuccinos look delicious, but I've never tried them. That's not really my jam.

"This place started for us as a quick stop to grab a bubble tea for my wife and I. It was nice and convenient, located very close to my wife's work. On days that I would show up early to pick her up from work, I would find myself coming up with excuses to get a bubble tea for her and a smoothie for myself. This practice has aided in earning me a brownie point or two over the years. The quality of the smoothie/ bubble tea bar is 5-star.About 1 year ago a Taiwanese friend of ours paid us a visit, and we decided to try the actual restaurant. They have plenty of the typical American Chinese food such as orange chicken, but our friend recommended actual Taiwanese dishes. The results were a little mixed. Some of the dishes were absolutely amazing, while others were quite weird. Overall the quality was very good (based on the opinion of our Taiwanese friend), even if some of the dishes were a little outside our comfort zone.To sum it up, if you want a good bubble tea or smoothie, you won't find much better in Reno. If you want to give legitimate Taiwanese food a try, this is a great place to start.",tensor(1),"tensor([1], device='cuda:0')"
Looking for a funky little place to hang out? This is it! Its got a huge wine selection and a cooler full of unique cheeses.

"I went here for lunch on a saturday afternoon and had a rather forgettable experience. This place looks like it would be a lot of fun with an outdoor seating area for live reggae music and a well-designed interior that that reminds you of the tropics. The prices are on the high side but the food itself is pretty good. The service is just god awful though. We waited 45 minutes from our initial order to get an order of bread  and a drink. It was another 20 minutes to get the actual entrees. The beef ribs and chicken jerk are authentic, reminded me of trips to Jamaica. The rice is so-so and the same for the cabbage and plantains and in my opinion, the coco bread isn't worth it. I would like to give this place a better rating because the point of going there was the jerk chicken but the service was terrible enough to make you regret going. That all being said, I'm planning on going to the live reggae shows they have and ordering take-out when the urge for jerk chicken arises.",tensor(0),"tensor([0], device='cuda:0')"
"I was quite reluctant to try the Montecito Wine Bistro, but I had an Axxess deal...  Wow, have they been wronged by Yelp!   I was more than impressed!!!The place is very nice, we sat by the fire and it was cozy and quite beautiful.   We ordered a salad to share, We had a beer and two entrees.   I had the Beef Bourgogne and my wife had the spare ribs.  Both were absolutely excellent!!!   I think that the salad was $8 and each of our entrees were about $22 or $24, they have a few less expensive items on their menu.   The highest price is $30 for the 10 ounce NY steak.   I might add that our meals were very generous and we had leftovers!  Service couldn't have been any better, our waiter checked on us a few times and the manager came by at least twice!  He was nice, from the old Piatti's which used to be in this location.  We talked about Yelp and I assured him that I would be giving him a great review... in part to right the wrong of all of this restaurants early reviews that still dog their overall Yelp rating.   I encouraged him to create a good Yelp check in deal... I hope that he does. If you are looking at Yelp to pick a great place to eat, please focus on the more recent reviews and you might just want to give them a try, it is really VERY, VERY good!Added:   I just read their reviews.   So many of the one-star reviews are by people who have written only a single review for this restaurant!  Very suspicious!  It looks like someone has it out for this place.

My gf had the most popular - for a reason - shrimp and grits. Both dishes were amazing. Her grits were creamy and the shrimp cooked and seasoned perfectly. The sausage gravy was spicy enough, but I still added some Crystal sauce for that extra sump'n. The sausage was legit sausage, not some pre-made in a factory to be the same flat shape sausage.

"This Wendy's just recently went through a much-needed renovation and it looks a lot better than it previously did. I walked in here to grab a lunch order recently around 12:30 and it was 80% full of dine-in customers. Unfortunately there was a clan of about a dozen senior citizens in front of me that couldn't make up their minds. I walked out, got back into my car and went right to the drive thru. The employee taking my order was clear through the speaker and very polite. I got to the window and realized I forgot an item and she added it on my order, updated my price and took care of it very easily. The drive thru process saved me a few minutes, as I'm sure the staff inside was just as efficient as the drive thru staff. My food was good and hot when I ate it. The fries didn't have a ton of salt, which I really prefer. My burger wasn't very big but was good. Inside was a very nice flat screen TV, which I have never seen in any Wendy's before. They also have the Coke freestyle machine, which is a very nice feature. This Wendy's is by far one of the nicer locations in all of Tampa. My issue with Wendy's is that they advertise these huge juicy burgers on TV. They look fantastic but when you unwrap them it's very disappointing as they are extremely small. I get that every restaurant does this during advertising, but Wendy's really exaggerates their product on TV. Wendy's is like a person on a dating website that displays their best pictures and their best qualities, except it's nothing like the pictures when you see it in person and is a major disappointment.",tensor(1),"tensor([0], device='cuda:0')"

The small box had 8 of the 9 items, and a blow dryer would not fit. They told me to send a picture of the invoice they sent me, and they would respond by email.  72 hours later I received an email that they confirmed that all items were shipped and they could not assist me.  I called a second time and the lady told me to call the Post Office for further assistance and that the post office is responsible for my lost item.  I asked how many boxes were shipped, and she replied ""one"".  I informed her again that the box I received had the small items in it and could not hold a blow dryer.  She said there was nothing she could do.  They reviewed a video and it showed the items being packed. I was placed on hold several times. She told me to take a picture of the package box used to ship the items and email it.  I sent the pictures of the box with a Capri Sun package beside of it to show that a boxed blow dryer would not fit in the box.  Have not heard anything several days later.  Very frustrating!!

The food showed up after not too long. We had an order of the wings and loved them. The seasoning was perfect and they were exceptionally moist. I ordered the chili which came with *the best corn bread I've ever had*. We got an order of the ribs to go which the rest of the family devoured.

All this and mas at totally reasonable prices too. I recommend trying out a cherimoya if you've never had one - it's a real treat!For more info on the weekly schedule, check out the website - the one on Saturday is on the corner of Santa Barbara and Cota Streets and it goes from 8:30 to 12:30.

The two sides were beans and greens. Out of the three meats the sausage was the least worse. All were dry and the sides did not have favors I would expect. I did not like anything. You even had to pay for bread.  I tried covering them up with the bbq sauces however even those were strange tasting. The sweet was pure molasses. The house was the only one I could tolerate.  I think they need to hire a cook that has tastebuds. We tried the apple crumble pie for desert and we even threw that away as it had no sweetness at all and no texture.  The price was crazy.

"I highly recommend Rebecca to plan any event!!! Our wedding was held in July 2017 at Our Lady of Mount Carmel and San Ysidro Ranch.Words cannot express the gratitude surrounding all the effort, professionalism, grace, speed to action, constant communication that Rebecca showed throughout the planning process. Rebecca is so highly connected in the industry whether in SB or LA and has so many connections that it made our decision making process that much easier.  Rebecca was tasked with 10 weeks to plan our wedding at Our Lady of Mount Carmel with a reception at San Ysidro Ranch coupled with a welcome dinner the night before held at the Lark. We went from about a guest count of 20, not planning on adding rentals...to a guest count of 50 with every single detailed planned to perfection.  Rebecca took the lead on one of the most important items - the timeline and boy did she stick to it!  Secondly, from our furniture rentals, to music, to dishware rentals, lighting rentals, working with the incredibly talented Camillia Floral Design and my favorite photographer Jessica Claire my dream wedding came to life in a matter of a few weeks and was captured by a spectacular photographer all thanks to Rebecca!!!! Lastly, The day of my wedding Rebecca kept me on time, calm and helped to handle the typical family drama that may occur.  Rebecca worked seamlessly with the church coordinator, Dori and the ceremony was perfect!!You made my day SO special and I cannot thank you enough Rebecca.

I went in for lunch earlier this week to try out the vegetarian hoagie... i had the veg special. It was delicious. The roll very crispy and fresh, the flavors very strong- jalepeno, cilantro, sauteed veggies, tofu, and some sort of yellow mayo that I always think is a dessert (mango pudding?) when I see it in the case.  Anyway the sandwich is delicious, and although prices are now $4 for a sandwich (up from $1.50) its still a steal for a quick lunch.  I also tried the rice and mung beans with coconut milk for dessert- delicious, an excellent way to add a little protein to a yummy dessert.

"Ace hotel is one of my favorite places in the city.  It has it all.  It reminds me of Miami, I'm not sure why, but it does.  The vibe is a bit more sheek and upscale.  I know its New Orleans and anything goes but please don't show up in shorts and flip flops.  Prices are high but you get what you pay for, go to bourbon street if you want jello shots. I haven't stayed in the rooms, this review is specifically for the bars.  Because well...I drink, not sleep.The hotel is huge.  Its in a prime location too. There are 4 bars and several event rooms spread throughout.Lobby Bar is the main bar.  It has great drinks. Happy Hour with a limited menu of drinks and bar snacks (get some meatballs).  Although the space is large, it can be difficult to get a drink, the bar itself is not too big and service is slow - mainly due to the craft cocktails.  The decor is open, minimal seating, sort of sleek, mid century.  Three Keys is a hidden music space that opens up at night.  They have a weekly calendar or events that play here.  Some have amazed me.  Everything from folk music to 80s/90s DJ.  The vibe is different any given night.  Wednesday tends to be a good crowd, especially during spring wednesday in the square concert series.  Josephine Estella has a bar as well.  This bar is faster but has a different menu and isn't as loungy.  You feel like you're in a restaurant - not a bar.

There was a group of 10-15 of us and the restaurant was spaced out well to where we did not feel crowded. We started off with the chicken 65, veg pakora, and shrimp Manchurian. All came out with good timing, hot, and fresh. The chicken was quite juicy and had the right amount of heat, the shrimp were plump and buttery, and the veg pakora were crispy and did not have that super oily taste that they sometimes can have. We ordered the lamb tikka masala and the tandoori chicken for our entree and I will have to say the lamb melted in our mouth. There was no gamey taste yet it definitely still had a nice lamb flavor to it which was accompanied well by the gravy. The tandoori chicken was good but I would not say anything special- it was lacking in the umami department although it was a nice pieces of meat. We ordered everything medium and it had the perfect amount of heat ( I would say we like heat but not anything that is going to make us sweat).

"I surprised my girl with dinner at Bailey's Range, and she was excited to go!  Being a burger aficionado, I was happy to indulge my girl's burger passion.  At the same time, we were excited because the Range makes everything from scratch -- and I mean everything, right down to homemade buns and homemade sauces.  If they made their own glassware, plates, and silverware, I think they would have taken the experience to a whole new level!  We got there shortly after the Range opened, so seating was not a problem.  Our server took our drink orders.  She had a dark beer, and I had the ""Sweet Sweet Bacon"" -- a milkshake with Maker's Mark, candied bacon, and salted caramel ice cream.  The shake was good -- I think mine might have had a little too much Maker's Mark, knocking the balance of the drink off, but I didn't mind -- it had been a long week up to Thursday...!  We skipped appetizers and went right to mains.  She ordered the American burger, and was more than happy.  Then again, who wouldn't want a fried mac'n cheese patty atop their burger, which was cooked medium rare (appropriately the way she wanted it) on a soft bun (double score for her!).  I ordered the Ahh Jamn!, which was supposed to come with bacon jam, red onions (I had asked for caramelized onions), mushrooms, and cheddar cheese.  When my burger came out, I was ready to kill it, so started enjoying it.  About midway through the experience, it dawned on me -- ""...is this my burger?""  I didn't really get the taste of bacon jam or mushrooms, though it looked like it might have been on there.  The cheese enveloped my burger, so it was hard to tell whether I had the right burger.  But I pressed on anyway, because I was hungry.  We also ordered a large order of fries, and asked for their house mayo and house cheese sauce.  The fries were great, and the homemade sauces were divine.Overall, this was a good experience.  In hindsight, I should have said something to our server regarding my burger, but I chose not to.  That was my bad.  That's the only reason why I give Bailey's 4/5 stars rather than 5/5 stars.  That being said, that only means that I'll be back there again to try something different, because Bailey's Range is worth it!",tensor(1),"tensor([1], device='cuda:0')"

"This place could have a lot of potential under the right management and with some renovations.  Unfortunately, this place feels as though it is one step away from going out of business.  The positive were the prices.  Decent prices.  The hotel does have some cool architecture but it has been neglected.  The place smells musty.  The rooms are nice though.It is kind of sad because I see a lot of potential in this place under some good management.  The overall negative was the staff.  Every single person we came into contact with was clueless. It feels like they are running on a skeleton staff. You are always waiting and waiting for someone to help you.  The wait-staff in all areas is slow and confuse. The only good waiter was Michael in the restaurant.  He is very nice and professional.  Ask for Michael if you are eating in.  The food was not very good either.  The burgers were overcooked and the calamari was greasy.  The steak was weird and rubbery, but the salmon was decent.  With the low prices brings a slightly wild crowd.  The pool gets a little wild on the weekends.  The spa could be nice, but the massage prices are way too high.  You can go just down the road for something just as good for half the price.  They charged $170 for an 80 minute massage.  That's about as high as it gets.  The massage was decent but you can find cheaper within walking distance.  Nancy gives a decent massage.  If I had extra money and time, I would buy this place and whip it into shape because I see so much potential.  Unfortunately, I would not go back unless it was under new management.  By the end of the trip, it was just too much.  The place was dirty and the staff was bad.  We should have stayed home.",tensor(0),"tensor([1], device='cuda:0')"
"Best burger joint I've seen in a while. Nice variety on the menu as far as burger/cheesesteak/pork style sandwiches go. And they do a different special sandwich every week;which has consiquently bumped me from a semi-regular customer up to a once or twice a week reg. Service is friendly from the cashier to the fry guys to Josh and his happy helpers in the back. They're always helpful and enjoy chit chat and quick jokes. They seem to genuinely enjoy their job and social interaction. It's always fun to catch them jamming out to the eclectic rock station always playing for ambiance. Just a chill group of guys n gals.I don't want to call the space SMALL because it doesn't feel cramped. It's more like its interactive and fitting for a fast-moving burger joint. Think diner meets pizza place meets local bar type of feel. Low rise tables in front for relaxing, some hightops with a different perspective in the corner, and the bar-style counter make it so u can pick your style comfort. With paintings and articles all over, you're bound to have some conversation pieces nearby as well.Everything seems clean. From tables floors and counters, to the separate area in the back for butchering meets, to the clearly labeled bins for different trash and recyclables.Overall 5star for these guys.

The second time, I gave another try......I went with 11 people and ordered their pho......I found out that the flanks were shining green.....which was clear to me that the meat quality is bad....it has FUNGI....they're ROTTEN!!!! The worst thing was that it was not only my bowls but also others....So we asked the server NICELY if we could just changed all to the rice dishes instead and pay the extra.....but the first thing they did, flew to the kitchen and brought us the rare flank and argue that the meat was fine.....Like duhhhh one bowl is ok but it's like all 8 BOWLS WITH ROTTEN MEAT!!!!

Someone complained about all of the references to In-n-Out, but I think the comparison is completely appropriate.  The style of burger is similar and it gives a person an idea of what kind of burger to expect.  It is similar, but in my opinion, a little better.  Maybe because we of the weather, or because there was a teriyaki burger option.  Had a bit of a regular char burger too, and that was solid as well.  But my onion rings were what was really good.  Crisp and you could actually eat it with the onion.  The onion didn't come flying out the first bite like most onion rings.  The berating on them was really good.  I would also like to say how awesome it is that the habit's burgers come with caramelized onions automatically.

"We tried this place for the first time last night. Being a Saturday night during March Madness the service was a bit slow. The complimentary chips took longer to get to the table than my husband's salad did. Thankfully they had one of the nearby televisions playing a kid's movie to keep my 3 year old happy. Back to the chips, they are home made and were fantastic. I went the safe route and ordered a burger with seasoned fries. It was wonderful. My husband ordered the blackened chicken and while it was good it was a little over seasoned making it a tad too spicy. My daughter had the kid's macaroni and cheese. It looked wonderful but she couldn't stop eating the chips, LoL. The seating inside was a bit weird. There is a table about 2ft from the door to the women's bathroom. Maybe I'm weird for thinking it's weird but I ended up waiting until I got home to go. They offer a 15% military discount which was great. Overall I'd definitely recommend this place.

Pros:-Tour guide was nice and somewhat knowledgeable of the cemetery and French Quarter.-Great price on groupon (2 tickets for $15)-Meet up location was easy to findCon: -Voodoo part was less than ten minutes long and it was inside the Visitor Center, which had nothing to do with the tour itself (used for a bathroom break and to purchase drinks/snacks)-WALKING tour -- when the tour was booked, I wasn't even notified that the tour would be in the heat-Though the tour guide was nice, she was very unenthused over the topic-The cemetery tour was about an hour long. It was interesting to see the different tombstones, however, how many can one possibly see before getting bored? After a while, it was a repetition. (MAYBE visiting more than one could've been more interesting?) -The closest part about voodoo was visiting Marrie LaVeau's burial site.

"One of my favorite places in town. This is a hole in the wall and not a place that you come to sit and enjoy your meal. It's really best to take it away, because the dining area is usually a little dirty.Family-owned and -run, there always seem to be the same people (and, sometimes, their kids) behind the counter.I mainly come for the tamales, tortillas (voted Best of Tucson for a couple of years, and they include one with most combo meals) and flautas. Man, those flautas... They also have what I think is some of the best salsa in the city. Not too spicy, well-balanced, nice color, good consistency... like a fine wine. I'll usually save their salsa cups for use with other Mexican food that I get later.If you like fake cheese nachos, then this is your place. But do yourself a favor and tell them to hold the onions because, otherwise, you'll find one has exploded in your container and it will take you two days to get the taste out of your mouth.The best part about this place though is the price: cheap, cheap, cheap! Most of the combos run about $5 and include an entree, rice, beans, one tortilla and a couple of salsa cups. I usually make myself a little bean & rice burro when I'm done with the meal. Good stuff!I'll only recommend this to some people, if I know that they won't be offended by what a sh*thole this place is. No, honestly, it's a really crappy building.

It's all so clean, too, which is a huge plus.There's a little section with baked goods, some Asian and some more American. They have mostly Vietnamese food, but I also saw some other types of food (e.g bulgogi).I came in with two friends and the woman who helped us was really personable and friendly. We ordered banh mi and boba tea, and sat down waiting for our food to be brought to us. The banh mi was really yummy, especially the bread. I had boba milk tea, which was as good as any milk tea I've had before. They have a drink card which you can get stamped to receive a free tenth drink. Definitely an incentive to return. Also, their hours are awesome, which is a huge plus.",tensor(1),"tensor([1], device='cuda:0')"

"What an awesome hip, bluesy joint that knows how to do a sandwich justice. I mean the love and attention they provide to proving quality products is hands down top notch. The roast beef is off the chain!!!! To taste roast beef with such a rich flavor and be extremely moist and delicious and don't even get me started on their bread. I mean sturdy enough to hold the heaping mounds of meat and toppings and yet still be delicate enough to yield a soft and airy loaf. I'm a sucker for their original roast beef on garlic cheese bread. I love their chip selection, it's not your ordinary run of the mill variety but why would it be, nothing about this place is ordinary. I love eating the other half of my sandwich the next day, now that speaks volumes of a true roast beef sandwich. The portions are large enough for me to eat half and be full and enjoy the rest for breakfast or dinner the next day. This place reigns supreme in the sandwich world!!! They're knocking it out of the park every time. You can't go wrong with whatever you select. I've tried 3 different sandwiches and everything has been delicious.

"My only hesitation to write this review is that it's almost trendy to review Tria, but the biz shouldn't be punished for it... My mistake is I passed by this place so many times thinking I should stop in, especially since it's packed, but figured the alcohol would be overpriced and food would be an expensive art project, at best. I was wrong. Rarely do you stop at a place like this. I've been twice and both visits were everything I'd want for a nice, casual dining experience. The first time I went we were the only ones outside (it looked like it was going to rain... and it did). The servers offered to reseat us immediately but we actually opted to sit outside and watch the rain. Everything was covered so it wasn't like our server got drenched coming to our table. I had a salmon sandwich, she had a salad and we shared a cheese plate. Everything was portioned and presented very well. The wine and beer they recommend went with the lunch nicely - we had a great time, so we came back a month later. This visit was equally enjoyable. We sat at the sleek bar for a drink before being shown to our table. I feel this spot is the perfect W.

This seems to be the best time to shop at Wal Mart, otherwise it it jam packed with people.One note; every time I go to this Wal Mart, the employees stare at me while I go to get my water.

On a main strip, easy to get in and out of.4. Double-sided drive up windows. And no call/order box. The best coffee stands put you face to face with your barista right from the start.5.

Had to ask for silverware and plates to eat the appetizer. We order their special app which consisted of 3 oysters and 4 clams, which were very fresh. The shrimp cocktail that came out was not.I ordered their seafood platter which was 3 shrimp flounder and a cluster of crab legs.

"It pains me to give this review because we've had a lot of good meals here in the past but our last two dinners here had identical problems.We went here for dinner last night. It was pretty busy for a Tuesday night so we expected a little bit of a wait for our meal. But the wait was compounded by service issues.We ordered the Vietnamese Pancake for an appetizer and Pho and Vermicelli for our entrees. Our order was taken pretty promptly but it took over a half hour for our pancake to be served. A party who arrived after us got their appetizer about ten minutes before us.It took another twenty minutes to get my vermicelli but Baby's pho was nowhere to be found nor did our server (the older gentleman) offer an explanation or apology. We waited a minute or two but when the pho still didn't come, I flagged down the other (young) server who said he would check into it. He came back apologetically alluding to some issue and promised it would come soon.Finally, about five minutes later, our original server delivered the pho without a word nor any acknowledgement of a problem. This is the same guy who at our last dinner forgot to place part of our order and then double charged us. It seems we're not the only ones whose order he screwed up. As we were taking care of our bill, we heard the party behind us pointing out that something was missing from their take-out order.The owner used to be here frequently but we haven't seen him in quite some time so I'm wondering if in his absence he's taken his eyes off the ball leading to the slippage in service.We really want to continue supporting Oriental Pearl so I'm hoping that they  take steps to get back on track.",tensor(0),"tensor([0], device='cuda:0')"

"This place does something magical and mystical -- you'll leave here heavier AND lighter!(That is -- you'll feel heavier, but your wallet will feel a lot lighter.)Stopped by here on a visit to Lumiere Place; figured it was worth a shot.  Didn't know anything about the pedigree of the chef or the place -- just that it was in the casino, I was hungry, and I was there.  Seated quickly (it was late in a Wednesday evening and pretty dead).  Server was attentive, patient to answer the questions I had, and was pretty efficient.First thing you'll notice when you open the menu - yeah.  Pricey, even for a gourmet burger joint.  You can either build your own burger (starting with a base at around $10 and adding on for extra ingredients ranging from truffles and caramelized onions to good ol' fashioned bacon and cheddar), or pick one of the select ones.  Those come with fries, so there's a slight savings there, since fries are separate for the main burgers.The fail here is that the burgers are about 75% the size of what you'd expect to get at the local burger hut.  That wouldn't ordinarily be a problem, except that the prices are about 25% higher than what you'd expect to pay at a gourmet/specialty burger place.  Yes, yes, this place is inside of a casino, so you'd expect it to be a little pricier, but it just seemed like it was a premium price for what turned out to be an OK meal.  This is a place to stop by if you're going to spend a night at the casino with friends and want to have something fun and cool to eat before a night of gaming.  It's not a place to stop by after you're done and looking for something casual and cheap to end the evening.I think the 3 stars is generous; the staff made up for this visit being kind of disappointing.  I can see where this place would be appealing; it just wasn't what I had in mind as a visitor.  Now I know better.",tensor(0),"tensor([1], device='cuda:0')"

"In short: Nice atmos, great food, nice portions. Mexican/ Spanish fusion Latin cuisine I suppose you could call it. On a recent getaway with my sig other in Montecito we came to this place on some Yelp recommendations. 5 stars for the food and portions. Wine list a little overpriced...They lost one star and ended up with 4 because the waiter didn't quite know if the plate had anything hot on it which I specifically asked NOT to have on my plate. Not into hot and spicy foods... Sure enough on a bite my head was nearly burned off to the neck from some burning hot green pepper in the mix... so I didn't appreciate that. That's a slack oversight on the part of the waiter. He obviously didn't mention it to the kitchen.For lunches and brunches they have a nice outdoor seating area as well. Also a full bar inside. They also have a totally separate cute little building, a private VIP dining area for parties / meetings and such but with a $500 min spend.We had a salmon and a seared sea bass entree.

I like that you have a choice of chicken, tofu, ground beef, pork or steak for all of their entrees. Another good thing to mention is that they provide a few gluten-free alternatives as well as vegetarian options. Their salsa bar gives you a choice of four different salsas to go with your nachos and entrees.

They have all the favorite pizza: pepperoni, combo, Hawaiian...this is not a fancy place, but it's a place where you'll get some good food. The guys that run it now are all Hispanic, and they have kept this place as good as the previous owners.

"My husband and I went for a weekend getaway to go snowboarding, and decided to stay at the grand spa suite. The total cost was around 300$ for two nights.

"Would give zero stars if possible. Let me start with the caveat that the band is fantastic, I would give them five stars. They are great performers and play very well (though I will grant that I do not know much about jazz). My complaint is lodged firmly with the people that run Preservation Hall. I didn't care about waiting in line, or the (looking back rather steep) cover charge. It was a little annoying that the room was set up more for a poetry slam than a jazz hall but whatever. No, my real complaint lies in how they have a ridiculous (imo) cell phone rule that they insisted on enforcing like the gluten-free ban at a Montessori school bake sale. When we got there there were multiple signs that warned against taking photos or video. This was really disappointing as I had really hoped to at least take a photo. But okay, as disappointing as it was, I hung in there (mostly because one of the people in my party really loves jazz and we had already paid the cover charge). The show gets ready to start and this lady comes out and gives this oddly pretentious speech (this is downtown NOLA, not Whole Foods) and reminds us like six times not to dare take a photo. This is only an annoyance at this point, like we get it, there are literally at least four signs in this room of forty people. Finally the lights go out in the room, musicians come out and I'm ready to chill. Now, one thing you should know is that Preservation Hall is that it is essentially a box of a room with large open doorways that lead out into a narrow hall that leads outside. The second thing you should know is that they leave the lights on in the hallway the whole time (they sell things out there). This means that anyone who moves around in the hallway is distracting, simply based off the light that attracts your eyes. Anyways, the music starts and for a few seconds it looks like this place just might redeem itself, like I said the jazz is great. Then, about two minutes in, the lady who lectured us before comes scuttling into the doorway where she starts peering into the gloom at the patrons. After a few seconds, she scurries back down the hall out of sight (again, this is really distracting because of the lights). At first I figured she was looking for someone or something but as she proceeds to repeat this performance every couple minutes I begin to realize she's policing the silent audience for the flash of a cell phone. Not only is this insane, (I didn't see a single person so much as twitch toward their phones) but if you have to police something with this level of intensity then maybe start a jazz club in a maximum security prison. After about twenty-thirty minutes the whole experience was so unpleasant that we all just left. 0/10 would never recommend.",tensor(0),"tensor([0], device='cuda:0')"
"I just moved to NOLA from Houston and was lamenting the lack of good Mexican restaurants to my friend when he suggested this place. SO glad he did! The queso was SO good...I filled up on that before we got our main dish. I ordered the seafood enchiladas and while they were good, they use a red sauce instead of a cream sauce. I would have preferred a cream sauce but these weren't bad at all. My husband ordered beef fajitas and those were good, too.I had a few margaritas and huh....that's funny. I really don't recall much else about the place.Oh yeah! It's good for groups. There were 6 of us and we all sat around a table laughing, cutting up, drinking the strong, strong margaritas, and eating the delicious queso.  Good service, good food, good times.

"I enjoyed Grand Isle so much that I came back twice during my one week stay in New Orleans!  Highly recommend sitting right up at the bar so you can watch the oysters being shucked - very cool!Trip One:It was my first night in New Orleans and I was starving!  I went on Yelp to see what was around my hotel and noticed that Harrah's casino was right across the street.  Having been the Harrah's in Atlantic City several times (more times than I'd like to admit), I knew that there had to be good restaurants associated with the casino.  I strolled into Grand Isle around 7pm on a Tuesday night, and thankfully it wasn't busy.  I took a seat at the bar and ordered my first local beer - the Nola Blonde.  For an appetizer, I ordered the shrimp gumbo - how touristy of me!  It was really good!  Everything shrimp gumbo should taste like.  For dinner, I decided on the house made gator sausage po boy.  OH MY GOD amazing!  The flavors worked so well together and the gator sausage was delicious.  I knew instantly that I'd be getting this again before I headed back to PA.I'm not sure if martinis were on special that night, but I saw a ton of them being ordered.  The ladies next to me got louder and more hilarious as the night went on, so I'm assuming the martinis were pretty good haha.Trip Two (two days after trip one):My boyfriend arrived in New Orleans and I told him I had to take him to a few, great restaurants I had tried earlier in the week.  We headed over to Grand Isle!  For an appetizer, we got the Isle Sampler of oysters.  All of them were delicious, but the oysters fulton (with bacon, cheddar, and onions) was my favorite.  So good!  For entrees, I once again ordered the gator sausage po boy and my boyfriend got the shrimp caminada po boy (which had apparently won an award at the po boy festival in the past year or two).  You've already read my review about the gator po boy, so let me tell you about the shrimp caminada:  IT WAS DELICIOUS.  Asian herb slaw was amazing and the shrimp was plentiful.  I can see why this won awards.We spoke with the bartender a little bit, who was a super nice guy.  Turns out he's from NJ, so it was nice to run into someone from our homeland.In short:  Go to Grand Isle.  Get some oysters, shrimp caminada po boy, the gator po boy, and a lot of beer (and maybe some martinis? haha).  You won't be disappointed!",tensor(1),"tensor([1], device='cuda:0')"
"I really wanted to like this place. Like really wanted to. But after a few trips, I've sadly come to realize that I don't love their donuts.

Like chicken, beef and such.1 order of takoyaki consist of 6 balls, cost around $5. Both are very yummy, though I like the original more.I will definitely go back for more and try on their Yakisoba.Make sure you put one hour on your parking meter if you order more than just one kind.

"As good as it gets (in St. Louis)! (I've had better in larger cities, but I've been to most every other sushi place in STL and really liked Kampai.)Me and two friends came here last night (on a Tuesday night) for the first time. The restaurant was mostly empty, maybe five tables filled at most throughout our time there. Service was attentive and helpful.I had the chirashi ($20, great food, but too much for one person; get it and share), another friend had a shrimp tempura roll and a spicy tuna roll ($15 total), and the third friend had a vegetarian roll and a veggie hand roll ($15 total). I also got the spicy tuna salad to go at the end of the meal. Most all rolls were under $10, with just a few at $11-14.The spicy tuna hand roll looked divine to me, but it had ""too much"" raw spicy tuna for my friend. In other words, big pieces of spicy tuna, not just little pieces like you normally get in rolls. My other friend seemed completely happy with his vegetarian rolls.The chirashi had a huge variety (one piece of each): salmon, smoked salmon, smoked albacore, raw albacore, ahi tuna, mackerel, shrimp, octopus, and probably some others that I'm forgetting. I also tried the uni (sea urchin), which was interesting, but I don't think the texture is for me.Surprisingly (in comparison to other reviews), we didn't get any warm hand towels. I got both miso soup and ginger salad, whereas my friends just got miso soup (maybe the complementary items depend on what you buy?). I didn't pay too much attention to the menu, though. I did order hot tea, and they had to keep refilling my cup instead of just bringing me a pot, so I guess a pot would have been nice.In general, I was pleasantly surprised by Kampai's variety and chef's tasting menu - neither of which I've seen at other sushi places. I'll be back and might even venture to try the most expensive ($80) chef's menu.And there is FREE (yes, FREE!) PARKING for Kampai in the garage right next to it. Go in and turn to your left. On quick glance, I think there are 10 spots designated for Kampai. If those are full, I guess you're out of luck and have to park on the street. (We managed to snag a free spot, making the whole experience pain free.)Delivery, take out, and catering, too - which I'll definitely keep in mind for the future!",tensor(1),"tensor([1], device='cuda:0')"
"Fantastic customer service both wholesale shopping and auto services. My tire was flat once and the mechanics went above and beyond (truly!) trying to fix it but eventually I had to get it repaired at a full service shop. The Costco employee felt bad and even offered to partially reimburse me for something that broke when they were trying to fix my tire (I turned them down but it's the thought that counts!). I will never forget how kind and hard they were trying to help me!Saturdays and Sundays are the days my boyfriend and I like to shop here because of all the delicious samples. The employees are all helpful, cheerful, and respectful. Place is clean, you'll find bargains, and produce is fresh and generally more healthy than what you find elsewhere. Some of the generic Costco (Kirkland signature) items are just as good if not better than brand names.Best of all, I hear you don't even need a membership to eat at their food court with bargain prices. $1.50 for a hotdog and a drink with free refills? $10 for a delicious WHOLE 18"" pizza? Too good to be true and yet it is!With competitive prices, gas prices usually the lowest on gas buddy, and membership perks, such as travel getaway packages, I found I have always made back my membership fee and then some with the end of the year reward coupon.

All those in my group order a sandwich for lunch and they all looked good and it was confirmed that they tasted good.  I took the other road and ordered the special of the day.  Tutto Mare with Caesar salad as a sub.  Although it was an upcharge it was nice to know that they didn't.  The dressing was the best I've had in awhile.  The pasta was very good and the sauce seemed to taste as though it was from scratch.  The only downside was the shrimp on the dish was shell on.  Its the first time I've had it with the shell on.  Although it was good it was very messing peeling the shrimp covered with a cream/alfredo sauce.  I'd go back for the sandwich/burgers but not sure about anything trying to be upscale.

"Review for HOTEL onlyStayed here on a stop over on the way to Vegas. It's right off the I-80 east but not close enough to hear any freeway noise. The room was clean, quiet and everything worked. Hot water, water pressure, A/C and heat worked. The bed was comfortable. I was on the 3rd floor and couldn't hear my neighbors through the wall at all. The only noise came from under the door, standard for most hotels I suppose, but nothing too bad. The quality of the stay in terms of the price is unbeatable. The room was $47 on a Sunday night. I'm sure it might be slightly higher for the weekend. The room is dated in terms of furniture but if that is not a big deal(which it isn't for me) then the stay is well worth the price. Included are some photos and there was some patchwork in the shower but again, I don't think that's a big deal.I will stay here again",tensor(1),"tensor([0], device='cuda:0')"
"To the reviewer who said 'best Carne Asada burrito ever', absolutely agree! It's yummy, and huge. The Carne Asada in general is excellent at this restaurant. Their shrimp is excellent and their tacos are good. Honestly I haven't had anything here that I didn't like. The food is really good and very authentic Mexican. Before taking your order they bring you chips and salsa. The chips are authentic themselves, which means they're not all salty as you would expect American chips to be. But you don't need them salty when there's salsa, plus they bring you limes which are an excellent addition if you squeeze them over the chips. The staff is very friendly and helpful but not in your face as at some restaurants. The building is nice, and it's a really pleasant atmosphere. Plus the food doesn't take very long to come.It's definitely not a fancy restaurant, so if you're looking for someplace for a special occasion you might want to look elsewhere.

"I originally gave this place four stars and a great review, but that was because I had only experienced this place one time and now I've changed my mind. I just ordered a pizza from Empire and they said they are currently out of cheese and can't make my one pizza. HTF do you run out of cheese at 6 PM when you're a pizza place? I understand there's a Cardinals game on tonight, but management is supposed to take things like that into consideration when running a pizza business.What's even a bigger joke is the fact they are supposed to be open until midnight tonight. So I guess it's only Italian roast beef sandwiches and cola for anyone who tries walking in for a pizza.  This isn't the only order fail I've had with this place. It's not uncommon for them to not answer the phone or to be out of certain ingredients on a regular basis. There's no point in looking at the menu because you have a 50/50 chance it won't be there. Maybe they need to hire new management who will know how to keep up with the high volume, otherwise I can see this place losing a lot of customers over the next few years and eventually closing just based on the fact it's a gamble when one goes to order their food. Talk about an unsustainable flash in the pan business model that's obvious at it's peak. Too bad it's only down hill from here. (I am writing this review hoping the owner reads it and actually does something about the problem. I'm sick of bottom feeding business owners who don't care). The pizza was good the one time I was able to order it, though. But certainly not worth going through the headache of dealing with them again.  I just ordered Imo's...

I have never had a bad flavor here and the staff are more than generous in letting you sample the flavors to make your decision. You can mix 2-3 flavors depending on the size you get as well. They also have solid coffee-fu and make a mean espresso. It is also a really nice mellow space to hang out in with lots of dark wood and a pressed tin ceiling (I am a total sucker for these); I like to play boardgames there with friends. There is a nice outdoor seating area now as well with a gate through which you can bring your canine companions to lounge with you (or I suppose felines on a leash).

There's enough selection on the menu to satisfy most people that aren't big sushi fans.  The specialty sushi roll menu is huge, many original selections and combinations, though I would call these rolls, ""American Sushi"".  They also have a traditional sushi menu, and if you sit at the sushi bar on a slow evening, and they know you, they will let you come up with your own custom roll !  One of my favorite rolls is the ""Sexy Man"" along with the ""Fat Bastard #2"" yes these are real names of their rolls. About the only thing I could critique is the time to get your sushi order can take over 30 minutes on a really busy evening.  Still way worth the wait, and it gives you an excuse to order more sake !

We waited over an hour and a half for food and asked to speak with a manger maybe 20 times during the entire experience, needless to say he never came over. Jen and Marcus handled everything perfectly, which is the only reason I'm rating this place 3 stars. It was happy hour and they kept us entertained and in good spirits while we waited forever to eat. When the food finally arrived everything was delicious. Marcus recommended The Johnny with fettuccine Alfredo and it was excellent. My wife also enjoyed the Johnny Rocco salad. We would definitely dine here regularly once all of the kinks are worked out but management needs to realize that this is New Orleans there are plenty of place to enjoy good food.

"I made a reservation at Muriel's for myself and three friends, after reading the glowing reviews. We wanted to eat somewhere fun and elegant over the holidays, and Muriel's fit the bill. Overall, it was a leisurely dining experience in a nice atmosphere, but there were some missteps.First, the menu and prices on the website were different than what we were given in the restaurant. Not a big deal unless you have your heart set on something before you go.Then, we were served in a weird order. Three of us ordered the prix fixe menu, which includes appetizer, entree and dessert. One friend also ordered a salad and I ordered an oyster appetizer in addition to our prix fixe dinner. First, my two friends got their goat cheese crepe appetizer and I got my oysters. Then, after we ate that, they brought out MY goat cheese appetizer and my friend's salad. I would have thought they would have brought our oysters and salad first, then bring all of the goat cheese appetizers, but whatever.The oyster appetizer was simply okay: fried oysters set atop shells containing creamed spinach. The parmesan cheese on top was crunchy and not pliable. Obviously not their signature dish.The shrimp and goat cheese crepes were to die for. The crepe was light and tender and the cheese filling was creamy and savory. There was something off with the shrimp though...they were those transparent shrimp, I don't think they were gulf shrimp.For my entree, I had the pecan crusted puppy drum. Only certain bites of it were flavorful for some reason. I tasted my friend's chicken and it was terribly dry. I tasted the other friend's barbeque shrimp, it was so delicious, it made me regret ordering the fish.The flourless chocolate cake was really good. The servers (all women) were very professional.My dining companions and I all dressed up, but there were many diners there in jeans and t-shirts.TIP: Do not park in the French Market lot behind Cafe du Monde. Muriel's validates for up to 3 hours, so it's very tempting. The lot is dark and isolated and there are not visible security personnel around. When we were going back to our car, there was a guy in an alley, sitting on a bike. As soon as we passed, he pulled out and rode behind us all the way to the entrance of the lot. When we turned right to go to our car, he rode off to the left, and we breathed a temporary sigh of relief. Within two seconds, he made a u-turn and started pedaling to catch up to us. My friend and I RAN to the car and jumped in, and he rode past us, circling the lot. When we got to the ticket booth, we informed the cashier that a man on a bike was lurking around the lot and we asked if they had a security person who could pass through the lot. She acted like she couldn't understand what we were saying and waved us off with a a dismissive, ""Okay, okay.""  Pay the extra money and park in a more populated, well-lighted area.",tensor(0),"tensor([1], device='cuda:0')"

"Just had our Wedding here Saturday November 3rd at the Singleton Pavilion - was absolutely perfect. We booked an ""off season"" wedding (Nov-Feb) so got the venue for about 1/4 the normal cost, the view was just amazing. Lush beautiful trees and well kept lawns made for the perfect day. They had grounds keepers there the morning of to clean the restrooms and clean the grounds, also had parking attendants there to guide our guests to our venue. If you do book Singleton versus their much larger venue Godric Grove the only major downside is the parking situation - you're guests have to walk quite a ways to get to your venue. And, besides electrical outlets and a sink - its pretty bare. No lighting anywhere so you need to be prepared to have all of the basic things covered. The staff was perfect with communication during the booking process and called to confirm everything 1 week prior. Very, very happy with this venue.

"As much as I like chicken wings and local restaurants here in Tucson, I don't know how many more times i can stand WOB. As for the wings they are great, always large and perfectly crispy, and totally drenched in sauce. I haven't tried anything else on the menu that I can vouch for. My issue with this place is the service, on the phone it always seems like an inconvenience that I am calling in an order and the call is always rushed. And in person when we are feeling daring enough, the staff always looks like they are in the weeds or behind on all their work. What has brought me to write this review is the mid 30 looking, tall server. Her attitude is unnecessary, her guest interaction screams lack of training and her aura if this counts for anything seems like a black cloud moving through the restaurant. I don't usually let service bother me as long as the food holds up but I just don't like her. And that's that. I'll finish up this dozen of hot, wipe my fingers and contemplate dining in again.",tensor(0),"tensor([1], device='cuda:0')"
"One of my favorite spots in Tucson! The Restaurant: A romantic and dreamy atmosphere in a historic train depot. They told me at my place of employment to be a ""women's libber"" & not rely on any Prince Charming coming along to take care of me. Whatever...when he comes, I want him to propose to me at Maynard's. Fabulous ""French-inspired"" American cuisine. Sunday Brunch is excellent! I love the creamy white polenta -- delish! Now that the weather has cooled down a bit, you can still enjoy it outside with the toasty patio heaters.The Bar: Great Happy Hour, Monday-Saturday, from 3 - 6 pm. It's hard to find establishments with Happy Hour on the weekends! They feature $7 bar eats, and 1/2 off glasses of wine, wells, and drafts. They usually have a couple of cocktail specials, as well. On my last visit, I was pleased with a cocktail called, 'Tequilas' Dirty Sister' (resposado, raspberry habenero shrub, grapefruit, and bacanora). It had a nice kick!The Market: After a brief construction hiatus (although it seemed like an eternity to me), they re-opened at the beginning of November. The first items I grabbed upon their return were sautéed Brussels sprouts w/ grapes (from the deli case) and a bottle of Pinot Grigio to go. Good choices! I'm still making my way through trying some of the items in the newly designed market, but I have especially loved the Croque Monsieur (Madame with a sunny egg) and the raspberry cheesecake in a jar. If you return the jar, you get a $1 off your next purchase. Available seating has expanded in this new layout, with more space to dine-in. I often come here just for grab-and-go meals, though. I love the take out salads & sandwiches (kale Caesar, superfruit grain, portobello w/goat cheese sand, etc....YUM!). You can also find Isabella's Ice Cream and Tucson Tamale Co.'s tamales in the freezer.The Wine Club: 2 bottles a month (1 red, 1 white), 25% off cases, free monthly tastings, and discounts on wine dinners -- $60 for a 3 month membership or $230 for the year.

Did not like this hotel at all. Me and my husband stayed there one night after getting off our honeymoon cruise out of New Orleans. While still on the boat I called the hotel to let them know that we would only be staying one of the two nights we reserved due to some issues with our home in Houston. We had to leave early to address them in person. I communicated that with the manager who stated that he would call me back because he was dealing with another customer. Never received a callback. We checked in Saturday March 5 at 1600. We left the next day Sunday March 6 at 1130. As we checked out I told the manager it was an early checkout and he said that I would have to talk to the third party vendor (booking.com) to not be charged. I was okay with that. Fast forward to today. Called booking.com and the customer associate stated that the manager charged me for the second night that I never used as a penalty for not warning them of our ealy check out. He lied. I spoke to him at least twice about us leaving. DO NOT STAY HERE IF YOU ARE OUT OF TOWN. VERY UNCLEAN AND DISGUSTING and the management is sketchy.

Sometimes I come between shipments and they're out of stock, but it's never something so critical I can't come back another time.Bring your own bag - it's the best thing to do.  They can provide you with a bag if you really want one.Bicycle parking - yes, yes there is!  Street parking... well, it can be hit or miss depending if you have to pay because of the Arena events.  Check the meter before you walk away - it will tell you if you need to pay.

"Great prices, especially being locally owned. It's obviously not going to be cheaper than, say, Walmart, for most items... but it's a muuuuuch better alternative. The employees are unusually helpful and friendly. They have a huge selection of everything. The produce is fresh. They have the usual cuts of meat, plus a section of freshly made options like stuffed pork loin, stuffed chicken, cajun burgers, blue cheese burgers, stuffed mushrooms, stuffed peppers, etc. I also feel that I should mention the alcohol selection, because I don't think anyone has brought that up in a review yet (kidding). So good... and cheap!!!The bakery is amazing, as is the deli. As soon as you walk in, you can smell the fresh-baked goods. Oh, and in addition to their regular King Cakes during carnival season, they have sugar free for those diabetics out there. It's actually pretty darn good, too, but a bit on the pricey side compared to their usual competitive prices. However, this is a novelty IMO, so I'll let that slide.The only downside for me is the narrow aisles and the parking lot where I feel like I'm going to get rear-ended, side-swiped, or possibly both at the same time by the old people in LARGE cars trying to fight over parking spaces. Do yourself a favor and park on an adjacent street, or in one of the side parking spaces if at all possible.They need to open a location on the Westbank... just because it would be more convenient for me (no, I didn't deduct stars for this - just a suggestion).",tensor(1),"tensor([1], device='cuda:0')"

I saw the good and bad reviews, but I'm fair and like to judge from my own experience, so I came in with neutral expectations. I came in with a group of six people. We ordered separately, I was the first to order. However, our food took 25 minutes, and when we asked what the holdup was, no one seemed to know or care. We did end up letting them know the service was poor, and the guy I was explaining to walked away as I was speaking! He flat out did not care.  At this point, that's just plain rude. We tried to complain to the woman managing the floor and her response was, ""oh.""  Apparently, we weren't the only ones complaining, as we were walking out, another customer walked in to get her money back because her boyfriend has already been served and finished his food while she still hadn't gotten hers.

"I went to El Camino Real for a surprise birthday party for my cousin-in-law. A few of us went early to eat dinner before the guest of honor arrived. I was feeling kind of sick that day, so I opted for a chicken taco salad (which I judged to be a mild and non-offensive menu choice). I was shocked at how delicious a taco salad could be. I could have drank the cumin vingarette out of a glass. I was also instantly jealous, and began feeling better, when I saw what some of the other folks I was with ordered to eat. One person got the brisket and another got the pulled pork sandwich, and the aromas that were entering my nose were soothing and enticing.

"My sister, my great niece were at the Village and thought we'd give Cinnaholic's a try. I sure am glad we bought the mini cinnamon rolls but wish we hadn't bought any. The bread in the cinnamon rolls was dry (either cooked too long or stale), there was hardly any cinnamon filling and the toppings were horrible. Mine was supposed to be a standard cream cheese topping but it didn't taste like there was any cream cheese in it.  Maybe they gave me the wrong topping because it tastes like coconut. My sister got maple flavored which she did not like.  The 6 year old ate her cotton candy frosting but we did not like it.  To say the least, we scraped off all the toppings and still didn't eat all of the rolls. Perhaps this was a fluke but I seriously doubt we will come back to find out. Sorry.

"This place is excellent. I'm an amateur photographer and I have come here for multiple workshops because the education, the teachers, and the facilities are excellent. In terms of those workshops you can find them for about $30 on Groupon or LivingSocial and the classes are intimate enough with about seven people or less that you really can get the individual attention that really makes for an excellent experience. In fact you will get that personal attention because the teacher incorporates each student and politely requests that they offer their work for light critique. There are opportunities in every class for you to go outside and practice what you just learned by shooting on the surrounding streets.My only criticism regarding the workshops is that they are not as frequent as I would like as my weekend work schedule conflicts often times with their classes.This next section is about the print center and I've had nothing but a phenomenal experience there. I was completely new to Printing and Keith the master printer who runs the lab made an appointment and sat with me for about an hour to basically guide me through the entire process, give his suggestions, and work Photoshop to get the photos exactly as I want them. He has a profound amount of experience that he draws from and is completely understanding that I am a brand new printer. He even gave me recommendations for where to get my photos framed and was just a brilliant lead in the entire process of printing my photographs. I'll definitely come back and I will recommend it to you because they do have excellent facilities, friendly workers, and a wealth of experience.The actual building itself is quite large and I believe it's shared with some other organizations. Philadelphia photo Arts Center does have a classroom or two and a nice gallery to present whatever work they choose.Getting here is very convenient as I take the subway from Center City and walk about 10 minutes.

"My first time trying Indian. I would say my neutral rating is due to the service. The waitress didn't introduce herself or any specials and didn't  explain the menu it was just a ""what do you want."" We guessed and picked a few things, they were good. Then when the bill came she put it on the table and in under a minute came back and picked it up before we even looked at it. Waitress then said ""how are you paying"" I felt awkward because we hadn't pick it up and it was a first date and she put the bill in front of me. I was hoping my date would be chivalrous, and he was but it was uncomfortable with the waitress coming back picking it up and seeing we didn't put a card in the book yet , because we weren't ready and she kept putting the bill back down, in front of me!

"After living in the STL area for way over 10 years now, I am both ashamed and remorseful to admit that I ate here for the FIRST time just a few weeks ago. I am ashamed because it's a St. Louis tradition and remorseful because I missed out on it for so..many...years! This place is amazing. What is not to love! It's a factory where you can get a tour (Friday-Sunday, noon-5pm on the hour), there's a shop, bar, and dining area. They also host many event with live music on the weekends. It's fun to just kind of wander and look around - don't worry, you'll get a chance because there will likely be a wait before you dine. The beer is, of course, amazing. The Hefeweizen is my personal favorite and a great start for anyone who is not a huge beer drinker (like myself). Additionally, the food is homegrown and damn good. I had the pizza (recommendation from my server) and it was really spectacular, though I'm admittedly a pizza connoisseur so I enjoy a good pizza pie more than most probably ;P My date had a bison burger which was also really good. More fun info: the service is great! I think they tend to hire more funky and alternative people (like tattoo parlor staff) which I support.

"Friday, April 22, 2011Santa Barbara Eats: Tony Ray's Since my friend began managing downtown's newest mexican restaurant, he hasn't quit calling me to come in. Being the good friend that I am (or at least think I am), I decided to give into his hype.Tony Ray's, tucked away behind the State Street clamor, took me nearly twenty minutes to find, but in the end was worth the hassle.My friend and I chose to sit outside on this overcast Tuesday afternoon, mostly because the dribbling water of the patio's fountain - complete with plastic roses and hibiscus buoyed among its three tiers - was almost therapeutic. The restaurant's menu serves up your every day Mexican food, stuff you can find at just about every other taqueria or cantina in California. And like most other Mexican restaurants reaching out to their American counterpart, you find your burgers, steaks and chicken tenders served alongside fried papas. Munching on my chicken burrito, but more so picking at my friends steak fajitas, I recognized that there's a lot to appreciate from this hole in the wall.No. 1: the patio seating hosts a great view of the Riviera and De La Guerra Plaza; a popular hangout for Santa Barbara's homeless, but I digress.No. 2: The place is kind of a secret. With no front entrance to State Street, you'd never imagine a restaurant ever existed here. No. 3: This sit down lunch, complete with ice tea and more chips and salsa than you can handle, came to about $20. Nothing on this menu costs more than $10, except for the filet mignon, $24.Tony Ray's also holds karaoke night on Wednesday and Thursday nights.Hosting a full bar that's open for breakfast, lunch and dinner, the hole in the wall tries, and is worth giving a try. So if and when you go in, ask for Rony. Tell him I sent you.",tensor(0),"tensor([0], device='cuda:0')"
"Horrible experience all the way around. 3 hostesses standing around looking bored, told us 10 min or less to seat us, then 30 some odd minutes later ( because my husband complained there were numerous tables empty and we were the only people at the time waiting) we were seated and treated as if it were a chore for one of them to seat us, talk about being unwelcomed. We also asked about a table for 6 that was empty, as there were 5 of us, and were told that this table was reserved. When I pointed out that I had called prior the day before and was told that there are no reservations, the hostess just starred at me blankly. Once seated, there was a mix up with the wait staff regarding which waiter was to serve us, no big deal. We ordered drinks, an appetizer, and dinner as soon as that was ironed out, and the waiter was pleasant and apologetic. We asked for bread and got it, drinks came soon and we were off to a better start until 30 min later they brought out clams when we ordered raw oysters, when we explained to the food runner that we didn't order clams, he said that they ran out of oysters and clams was all they had. This was an odd explanation, and we sent the clams back of course. My daughter's Caesar salad was overdressed and had large bits of anchovy, so she didn't eat much of it. After waiting for over an hour for dinner (after we had ordered), my grilled shrimp, and rice on the plate arrived to the table cold and half of the shrimp were burnt. I was hungry and tired, it was late, so I just ate the shrimp and rice. The waiter was apologetic for the wait and seemed to be trying very hard. There were two tables that needed to be cleared nearby almost the entire 2 1/2 hours we were sitting there with food all over the floor, it was disgusting. I thought to myself that one of the 3 hostesses should have stepped in to help instead of standing around an empty lobby with a sour look on their faces. It's apparently a training issue for the staff and the kitchen. Everyone else's meal was served warm or hot, so mine must have been prepared an hour or so before everyone else's. My daughter's crab cakes had so much red bell pepper, it was almost as if it was red bell pepper she ordered with a garnish of crab. So, she ate 2 bites and came home hungry. My mom was promised her own small birthday cake (since we were there to celebrate her birthday), but that never arrived, and neither did the manager. We ordered dessert since it was her birthday, but I have to say that the key lime pie was so sour most of us couldn't eat more than just the one bite. Bonefish is so much better, as well as the Shrimp Boat. Brandon could really use another good Seafood restaurant however, but this is not one of them. I can understand that in 6 months or so, they will have their routine down and the staff will be trained with all of the kinks out, but for the high price and low quality of the food we won't be coming back. I have to say that if the food was good, we'd give it another try, but it just wasn't.",tensor(0),"tensor([0], device='cuda:0')"

"Da Vinci's had a 2/1 prime rib dinner special going and since my husband and I are suckers for food deals, we decided to try it.  In fact, we went there for the same special 3 times.  The food and service was great,  my only criticism is the yorkshire pudding that comes with the prime rib,  to me yorkshire pudding tastes like a greasy pancake and this was no exception. Dinner included soup or salad, we opted for soup was very nice, a butternut squash perfectly seasoned. Seemed like a great deal so we returned a few weeks later.  On our second visit..same food, same great service but upon receiving our check we noticed that we were charged $3 for each bowl of soup. We asked about it and were told that soup is no longer included in the special, not a big deal but it would have been nice to tell us that up front.  Third visit,  we ordered the same thing figuring that  even though the soup portion is small it's worth $3, but when we get our check it is now $6 a bowl.  We asked about it and were told that it's always been $6...Ok, so I guess we were hallucinating when we ""thought"" it was $3 the week prior.  In my opinion, they should have continued offering the special with soup, it just felt cheezy for them to take it out of the special unannounced, and then double the price on a 2 ounce bowl of soup without notice. My only other criticism is that without a discount or 2/1 special the food is overpriced.",tensor(0),"tensor([0], device='cuda:0')"

I was standing basically in the middle of the restaurant next to a couple's dinner table. Three people asked me my name after finally seating us. We brought two bottles of wine which they kept in the back. I read some reviews stating that the servers get snappy when you don't choose to order a dish from each section. This is 100% false. Our waitress simply told us how large dishes are and based on how hungry we are, we may not want all of the courses. We both started with the beet steak. Ugh amazinggggg, very savory, unlike any beet dish I've had before. If you like beets, I highly recommend this. For my main, I had bass with red quinoa (i think). It was very fresh and the portion was average for nicer restaurants. We shared the chocolate hazelnut and caramel torte which was divine.My major down side was the wine.

"With all the hype and positive reviews, I made a point to check this place out. I have to only give three stars because I was not completely impressed. I got the half rib with a side of mac and cheese and sweet potato casserole. The meat was definitely tender and soft but lacking on flavour. Even tried it with the sauces they have on the tables but I still felt like the ribs were missing something. I enjoyed the sweet potato casserole more than the ribs. Overall, thee meal was good but I think over hyped.They were out of brisket when I got there so maybe my review is skewed.",tensor(0),"tensor([1], device='cuda:0')"

If you are in Santa Barbara at all on this week of celebration and you love authentic Mexican food you must come here!  You will love all the great food they offer here and the dancing and music.  There is beer and wine.  I usually come here for a big bowl of pazole for breakfast, but before I do that you must order some tomales.  Get here early for the tamales because the line gets long.  This place is the real deal.  And not to be missed if your a serious foodie. Viva la Fiesta!!!",tensor(1),"tensor([1], device='cuda:0')"
"Was not expected much, until we arrived the it was packed outside. Not only was it packed but they were extremely efficient.

"It's surprising that you get as much food as you do for the low low cost that they charge.  I was hesitant to try my sandwich at first, thinking it must not be very good if it's that cheap.

I put a new battery in it and took it to Mike's because it was closest and I was afraid of getting a ticket if I went drove any farther.  It took the better part of a day, but when I went to pick up my truck I couldn't believe it.  It looked like a brand new car.

I wish I could buy the enchilada sauce so I could put it on everything, plus the fried egg on top (which I first thought was a very odd addition) is cooked to perfection with a beautifully running yoke. Although I still think it's a little annoying that if you order them with a meat it comes on the plate almost like a side, the dish is still my favorite.Plus the happy hour is pretty on point - half off on margarita pitchers that aren't scrimping on the booze, sounds good to me.",tensor(1),"tensor([0], device='cuda:0')"

I love sitting in the patio area with the view of Euclid.Food:1) Corn Chowder (special) - heard it was pretty good.2) Ligurian Shrimp Pasta - nice and fresh.  It def had a spicy kick to it, but not so much that someone like me who can't handle spiciness was able to enjoy a few bites.  Shrimp was cooked perfectly and were pretty large.3) Lobster Mac & Cheese (special) - pretty good.  Not swamped in cheese, though it lacked a little flavor (nothing some salt didn't fix).  Pretty big pieces of lobster.",tensor(0),"tensor([0], device='cuda:0')"
"I came here for my birthday as mentioned by Aria S. I made reservations for a Wed night for a group of 9 (this is their max). Good thing too, because every table was full. Since this is a BYOB, we had about 7 bottles of wine for the table. As I looked around, every other table had ice for their wine. I had to ask our waiter after about 15 minutes if he could bring us a couple ice buckets for the table. He took our wine and put it over on a window sill. This was a little strange, but it only got worse. We didn't know if it was appropriate to grab it ourselves or if he would pour it for us. We spent the entire evening walking through the restaurant to awkwardly pour wine. Not exactly how I wanted to spend my bday dinner. Its especially frustrating because this is a BYOB restaurant, you'd think this wouldnt have been an issue. Besides this, the service was fine. They also accommodate to the gluten free people out there.Onto the food. We started with dips of the day, very authentic and tasty. I ordered the braised rabbit leg. I thought the meat itself was fine. I wish it was seasoned better and more tender, especially for $26. Luckily I was able to try a few of my friends' dishes. My favorite was the stuffed pepper. I really wish I ordered that instead. Unfortunately I will not be coming back here. I wish I was able to have a great experience like some of the people below.",tensor(0),"tensor([0], device='cuda:0')"
"SImply not impressed.  I got a burger with blue cheese and carmelized onions. The meat was high quality, but the bread to meat to cheese ratio is all wrong.  The burger was very thick and as such left most of the bun meatless.  They could have made the burger thinner, gave it greater circumference, and not left me with a half grilled cheese/half burger scenario. Not a big fan, won't go back/order delivery.  Its simply not a good burger and at $60 for 2 people, I'd rather try the devil I don't know.",tensor(0),"tensor([0], device='cuda:0')"

I always felt safe going there, which is important in this area.The hours would be the only thing I would change. They close at 8 p.m. on weekdays and at 4 p.m. on Saturday. Also, they are closed on Sundays which was a bummer. Barnett's is more than A-OK in my book! In fact, I still find myself stopping here when visiting friends in the neighborhood.

Both were a hearty portion served alongside corn tortillas as a gluten-free alternative! The wait time for a table was long, but the service was friendly!

"Let me be frank and say I am a universal Schlafly fan. I like the Schlafly family, their products, each restaurant, and their presence in the St. Louis community. This review is based on several experiences. Bottleworks: Great beer and a nice atmosphere. You can bring your entire family, a group to watch the game or have a quiet date night spot. Food is of great quality and nice quantity. Waitstaff are some of the best in the City. I have never ever been disappointed with a server, manager, buser or host. One time a buser overheard my dad talking about a particular beer that was no longer on tap for the season. My dad was bummed because he had just discovered it and wasn't able to find it anymore. 15 minutes later the young man dropped off a mini-pint at our table and told us he had looked and found a tiny reserve in the back. Super impressive and wayyy beyond the call of duty.",tensor(1),"tensor([1], device='cuda:0')"

Brisket tacos, with BBQ sauce (I add the white sauce too), are splendid.  Tortas, burritos, whatever you pick, you're probably gonna be under $10 with a drink and chips, so splurge for the white, creamy goodness called queso.

"I like this Sam's Club because it is in an excellent location and has great prices ranging from Gas, Liquor, Food, and Electronics, Tires etc etc. Their warranties are also great and are not difficult to take advantage of when you need it. I love that I can go in there and spend less than 20 dollars and have a dish for a party that will serve well over 10 people. I also like that I can drive 2-3 extra blocks and find gas significantly cheaper. For example today the gas was approx 3.70-3.79 on 86th street. I drove a few miles down the road and got gas for 3.51 there. That is extremely well worth it when you are in a budget and drive an SUV. The gas alone is worth the membership. The only reason I gave them a 4 star rating and not a 5 is because for all the hard work they do they could pay their employees a bit more. Additionally their lines tend to get a bit long at times which can be nerve-wracking especially when there are employees who want/need extra hours.

"Reservations Gourmet- to-Go is often overlooked at as a Seminole Heights eatery but shouldn't be. Reservation offers up a convenient service for those without the time to cook. The kicker is, that if you have been to Reservations you'll crave it even when you have time to cook.  Reservations serves quality home cooked meals to-go and their weekly specials are huge deal for those that are budget conscious.Not only is Reservations good but they are also locally owned and operated. The owners Anthony and Elke live here in Seminole Heights and make everything from scratch.One order will usually serve a two people.  We have ordered 2 meals which easily served four people and we still had leftovers.  The order pictured to left included:Yankee Pot Roast, fork tender beef slowly cooked with carrots, onions, green beans and potatoes for $11.95Chicken Rustica,  boneless breast sautéed with crushed red pepper, garlic, capers, olives, tomato and Romano for $11.95The Yankee Pot Roast was good but the Chicken Rustica was fantastic (BTW I am a fan of olives) . The mashed potatoes are great and the salad's are above average. Other hits include the Chicken Marsala and the Meatloaf. Reservations also carries vegetarian dishes such as the Polenta Lasagna; polenta layered with portobellos, parmesan, mozzarella and pomodoro sauce.Reservation's specials change weekly. Make sure you sign up for their e-mail list which is on a clipboard on the front counter.There is seating at Reservations and its a popular lunch spot for those looking for a great sandwich.  The hot sandwiches are a must try. Topping the hot sandwich list are the Hot Meatloaf Hoagie and the Buffalo Chicken Finger Sub for $7.95 each.If you want to splurge a little you should try a piece of cake which will cost you $4.50.

"In a nutshell:  These guys are awesome to deal with.  They came on time;  They worked their butts off until the job was done;  They were very tidy and considerate of my property; and I got exactly what was promised at a fair price.The Details:  When my A/C went on a hot summer day I thought ugh, I wish I knew someone in the field.  I didn't, so I started reading reviews and calling around.  The main HVAC repair companies around town came across as contractors (middlemen) that would just end up costing me more money in the end.  I knew what I wanted.  I wanted to deal directly with the guy who was going to do the work.  Someone who cared about customer satisfaction.  Someone I could trust.  I found all those things and more when I spoke to Ray, the owner and operator of Trust Home Comfort.When I read some of the reviews on the competition, it seemed that the biggest frustration out there were people who were charged a couple hundred of dollars to get a guy out, only to be told that their old A/C was not worth repairing.  I didn't want that to happen to me, so I took the unorthodox approach of taking a brief video of my problem and posting it to YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iMHhimCqUo .  This will be great, I thought.  Saves everyone time, and hopefully me some money.  Right?Wishful thinking, none of the big companies were even willing to look at the video.  So I kept calling around.  Eventually, I got a hold of Van (the office guy) at Trust Home Comfort.  He was great!  He said ""Sure, we'll have a look at the video"", so I emailed him the link with some photos of my system.  I heard back a short time later from the owner of the company, Ray, who is a journeyman HVAC technician with a 4 year degree in Refrigeration Technology.  Ray told me straight up that he didn't think the problem was what I was hoping it would be (a low cost contactor part), but in order to know for sure he would have to come out and run a diagnostic.  They both reassured me that if I had to replace the entire system, I wouldn't be charged for the service call AND a new system.When Ray (the owner/technician) arrived the next day he took his electronic meter measurements, and was able to confirm that my compressor was shot.  I would need a new system. We sat down to discussed my options.  Ray was very honest and forthright about which system would be best for me.  He took his time and shared his experience about what other customers have liked. No high pressure sales.  No lies about pricing.  Just the straight honest goods you would expect from a technician.  I loved that.  We ended up upgrading our HVAC system to one of the new units that is VERY quite and comes with a 10 year parts warranty.  I think my neighbor was especially pleased with the ""quite"" part.Ray was even willing to do the job on a long weekend, even though he planned on taking it off.At the end of the day, we got a new ""Green"" A/C unit, a new updated humidifier, and a new WiFi thermostat which I can control from anywhere in the world through my iPhone.  All for a very reasonable price.  Very cool.  Literally!(My daughter's comment about this review:  ""Why don't you write a book"".)",tensor(1),"tensor([0], device='cuda:0')"
"My experience at The Mustard Seed was quite varied. I want to start off with the good parts:1. The Service- so friendly. I know the service industry is a tough one to be in, and our server did a great job and even offered us a complimentary dessert for our meal mishap (see below). 2. The Food- delicious! The Fried Mac & Cheese are a don't-miss! They are also served with the most delicious aioli that you should save for the rest of your meal. The not so good parts:1.The Meal Mishap- I ordered the Fried Green Tomato BLT but also explained that I don't eat bacon because I'm a vegetarian, and asked to have the bacon left off. I ordered this knowing that sometimes mistakes happen and blah blah blah hoping that there wouldn't be any bacon on my sandwich. But... alas! The sandwich came out and had bacon on it. Cue my body starting to sweat, and my cheeks starting to blush because I'm sorry that I have to send the food back... but I don't eat bacon! I tell our server about the mistake and she apologizes and brings it back to the kitchen...Then I have a chat with my boyfriend about hoping that she doesn't bring it back after just having the kitchen pick the bacon off and serving it. **More intense anticipation-sweating**. The sandwich comes back and... there was an inch-size chunk of bacon still sticking out of the side, but the main parts had been picked off. I brought to our servers attention what had happened, and that I would just like a to-go box because I could find someone else to eat it. Then, she profusely apologized and had the kitchen actually remake it. The re-made sandwich was fantastic. But, it is still hard for me to rid myself of the lack of respect The Mustard Seed seemingly had/has for dietary restrictions. I ended up a happy customer, but was also a little bummed. I don't know if I will return.",tensor(0),"tensor([0], device='cuda:0')"

Incredible experience: The ingenuity, the flavor, the precision, the plating, and the service were flawless.I've read other reviews as to ambience and it puzzles me as the beauty in Japanese style and aesthetics is about simplicity. It further underscores that with simplicity as the backdrop, the food can truly be the hero of the moment as described above.The only heartbreak of the evening is that we discovered the Chef and his lovely proprietor wife  lived in San Francisco. So my city lost a jewel; nevertheless, happy for Santa Barbara for their new found treasure.

"This is a great late brunch option during the weekends when the big morning rush dies down after 1 pm. Usually there is no wait or 5 minute wait at this time. One big complaint is that they don't have an organized system for seating guests. The servers don't always greet incoming patrons (which should be required Waffle House-style) and they sometimes tell you to seat yourself (which can lead to one or two people taking up tables for 4) or they'll seat you (whenever they get around to talking to you). I've ordered a several different dishes at this point and they have varies from ok to awesome. The chicken wings and onion rings are just ok. The wings are either lightly dredged in flour or not at and then fried whole. They aren't really seasoned so the wings are pretty bland. The ""onion rings"" made of formed, chopped onions that are breaded. The chicken fingers were a bit over battered and dry. The smashwich (or whatever it's called) was pretty good: your choice of breakfast meat with hash browns and eggs in a hoagie roll, but unspectacular. The club sandwich is classic diner fare that is very well executed. The egg and omelette platters are a very good deal and dang tasty. The best thing on the menu is definitely the waffle. It's gently sweet, very crispy and covered in butter. So good!The service is generally pretty attentive (once you're seated), the restaurant and bathrooms are very clean, the food is a good, tasty value",tensor(1),"tensor([0], device='cuda:0')"

If your food is not spicy enough, then adding some of those peppers will change that in a hurry. The place looks completely ghetto on the outside but it actually has a pretty decent interior.

"After a long afternoon of back to school shopping in the mall, I was dreading going in to the Apple Store to deal with my broken iphones.  However, I had such a great experience at this location, I decided to write a review. I've been to many Apple locations from NY to Fl over the years and I can't say the same of my experience.  As busy as they were, I was able to get an appt with the genius bar right away. I had two broken 4S iphones that needed to be looked at but I didn't clarify that I had two devices when I made the appt, Nonetheless, after the  Genius bar tech, Tim, took one of the phones, Guy Schiavi who was on the floor, made sure that the second phone was looked at as well. It was not a simple process as both phones required a thorough diagnosis but I was truly impressed by how patient and accommodating Guy was with us.  He worked on my tween's iphone and he walked her (us) through the process step by step and educated us on new tools on the iphone.  He also provided recommendations on phone accessories for me which I found very useful.  Unfortunately, the first phone (mine) was not fixable but my daughter's phone was fine.  More than anything, it was all about the pleasant experience and the special attention we received from Guy.  I will definitely return to this location for any future Apple needs!",tensor(1),"tensor([1], device='cuda:0')"

They were very sweet to my other 8 year old daughter who doesn't care to be touched and so didn't get her nails done. I got the basic pedicure, which I liked, but I think next time I'll go one up. My daughter had little flowers painted on her toes which she LOVED. The ladies were very patient and nice, and that goes a long way. The only thing that would really make this place awesome was if they acquired a couple of cute kid pedicure chairs.

"Don't judge a book by it's cover.  Looked like a any similar bar food type chain like Friday's, Bennigan's, or Ruby Tuesdays... JB Dawson's is far better.Awesome experience from the second we stepped in, hostess greeted us with a smile and time to table waiting expectation.  We were promptly seated, and tended to right away with a smile and good attitude by a server, Nancy, who helped us with a beverage and app order.  For our app we shared the twisted shrimp as it was Twisted Tuesday.  Nancy told us this dish far surpassed Bone Fish's Bang Bang Shrimp, to our surprise, it clearly did.  Our beverage and app shortly followed. Shortly there after another server stopped by, Kyle, who was our designated server.  Boy, smile, great greeting, great attitude, engaging.  We talked a bit, figured our way through the menu and placed our order.For our dishes, my wife selected the Four Cheese Mac & Cheese side -- Sharp Cheddar, Pepperjack, Mozzarella & Reggiano dusted with bread crumbs with cornbread as she had large lunch.  Very good.  Unexpected, light, not overly creamy, not burnt, just right.  And the corn bread with maple butter..... ahhhhhh that was really nice. I ordered the fish tacos-- 3 Flour tortillas, seasoned tilapia, chimichurri sauce, mango cilantro salsa & a lime cream drizzle.  Passed on starch sides and had their asparagus that was cooked to perfection.  To my surprise the they were filling, nice size portion (see photo)  not a two bite app.  Very moist and super fresh fish.Great first experience all around expect one key aspect.  Their so called craft beer menu was really limited and did not contain a variety of types; focused more on IPAs.  Limited thinking for the bar manager I must say.  Kyle our waiter also bar-tends.  We got to talking and he offered with no questions to swap out my beer for another option --- Stoudts Scarlet, which is a reddish beer.  For my beer palette it was better then the others limited options had a nice taste at the swallow then waned off.   Kyle informed us that they buy for all 4 restaurants and try to find a middling that works across the 4 guest demographics.  Not a great decision honestly.  There are so many great craft brewers in the Bucks County region and even Bristol area that should be showed cased and tested through.

I love the handmade soaps, the high quality essential oils, and the lovely ritual items.

"Went on the Cupcake and Macaroon Tour last weekend.  We went to four places.  The first business was a glorified coffee shop.  No cupcakes or macaroons. We were given half of a ricotta cookie.  Although delicious, it was not a cupcake or macaroon.  The second place gave us a quarter of a cupcake. They did not have enough of each flavor, so when it was my turn, the one I wanted was gone. The third establishment was so awful, they should have paid me to try their sample.  It was a vegan bakery free of gluten, dairy, nut, soy, egg and any other allergen one can think of.  I am sensitive to people with food allergies as my husband has them, but I'm not sure why this establishment was included.  How can a cupcake taste good after you've removed all of the key ingredients?  The last place we went to was the one that was supposed to have macaroons.  We were told they ""ran out"" and instead received a quarter of a defrosted mediocre cupcake.  How do I know it had been frozen and not fresh?  It was still partially frozen in the center!  Luckily, it was a beautiful day to be outside, because this tour left a lot to be desired.",tensor(0),"tensor([0], device='cuda:0')"

Boy do they deliver, the croissants were buttery, nice and flaky, and melt in your mouth...even better then some of the ones I had in France. Not surprisingly, the baker ""Nico"" is french, and you could taste the difference in the food.  The fact that the products are imported does make a big difference in the taste, it's definitely authentic.  Nico was very personable and friendly, it was fun chatting with an ex-parisian :).

This place looks small, but if you see that door near the back -- head down the hallway to another seating area that is basically the same size as out front.I also enjoy that New Day supports many local charities and events.

The breaded ravioli was fresh and delivered as soon as it was fresh off of the deep frier. The Buffalo Wings were perfectly, and evenly seasoned with sauce.

"I could say that this is a touch of Italy in a strip mall, but even I recognize that is a little too precious. Stepping into the dark, cool interior of Sapore made for a refreshing change after the sweltering July heatwave. It was no problem for our party of three to be seated; the fact that we had a reservation helped, I am sure. We started out with drinks--bellinis for my two dinner companions and a classic vodka martini for me. I appreciated being able to customize my drink with a blue-cheese-stuffed olive and an anchovy. I would never have thought to put an anchovy in a martini, but it looks like this will be a new obsession for me. On to the food. We opted to skip the appetizers and go straight to soup/salad and entrees (all the better to save room for dessert). My mom went with the Italian soup and my other dining companion and I split the Caprese salad, a solid presentation that did not blow me away, but certainly does not provide grist for anything like the negative reviews of this establishment that I have seen on yelp. I didn't know what to expect in terms of pasta portions here, so I went with the Chicken Marsala. It might have been nice to have pasta to pick up some of the sauce, but I appreciated that the dish was hot by temperature and I even had enough for leftovers (to which I added pasta, in the comfort and convenience of my home).The dessert selection was excellent. We went with the tiramisu. I understand Sapore also has an excellent cannoli which I would like to try on a future visit. I would be tempted to come back, if only for another excellent martini, appetizers, and another run through the dessert menu.",tensor(0),"tensor([0], device='cuda:0')"

We had the poke (so fresh and delicious) I got the special basil pesto shrimp pasta which was insanely tasty, boyfriend had THE STACK and the pork was super sweet and the slaw on top created exciting flavor profiles!

What a disappointment. Not what most expect with jazz bar/dining establishment. Not dark or comfy seating. I got a mojito and I do not think they could spare the mint. They had a sign about a cover charge at 8. They came over and said if we were still there at 8 eating we would be charged. The food was nothing special. It was about equal with Zattarans box foods. The shrimp they served in the jambalaya and gumbo could not be smaller. Service was lacking. They may want to look at improving the food and entertainment to fill their very empty establishment before they focus on a cover charge. To add the music was not worth the five and was not really jazz bar type. The bar was also cheaply done. If they do not change they will be gone in six months.

"Ok here's the deal - I REALLY wanted to like this place, especially with all of the great reviews.  It's not close to me but I made the trip because it is supposedly great!  Sadly it was underwhelming from the minute we walked in the door.  There were only a few customers, and the two waitresses were watching TV and barely acknowledged us.  One of them approached but didn't say anything, she just grabbed some menus and took us to a table.  She didn't ask for drink orders or anything, just brought us some waters without saying a word.  We selected several items from the sushi menu and waited for her to return.  And waited some more.  And some more.  Finally after about 10 minutes I got her attention and she came back and took my order sheet, again without saying a word.  The miso soup came out pretty quickly but it just wasn't great.  When the sushi arrived, I noticed it was only about half of our order.  I wasn't too worried about it though, because there was only one sushi chef behind the bar and it's not uncommon for places to bring out parts of your order over time.  Still, the service was just plain bad and I won't be back!",tensor(0),"tensor([0], device='cuda:0')"

"I had high expectations when I went to this place recently after some recommendations from friends.  We visited on a night when there weren't very crowded so it was nice to be able to have such an attentive waitress and service.  I was a bit disappointed when I didn't find as much on the menu as I would have liked to have seen that would appeal to me.  I guess I have become very picky with my Yelp addiction in terms of scrutinizing every establishment I go to pretty thoroughly.  I ordered the hummus appetizer for the table and was very pleased at the quality of the dish.  For my entree I ordered their Bricks Salad which had plenty of fresh produce packed in.  I ordered a double portion of chicken for it, which still seemed pretty skimpy especially since I was charged for that request.  Overall, I'd say this is probably one of Ybor's lesser known spots as its more on the western edge of the main strip, yet it seems very lively and upbeat.  I did like that they had featured lots of artwork by various local artists that were on display and offerred for sale.

The only thing right was the chips and dip, if you count that each chip was broke then maybe not. I should have taking pics of this mess I was given but I was to upset once I drove all the way home only to realize my order was WRONG and MISSING.. had no black beans and rice or sides for my enchiladas. You could barley see any cheese. I called immediately and spoke with the manager and was told that the enchiladas would been taken off my bill. No dinner than I hung up and opened the burrito I noticed I had no fajita peppers... none just rice beans and chicken..  I immediately called back. The manager agreed that the orders were wrong and she apologized and asked if I was close she would have the order remade, and take the entire order off my bill. Since I was feeding more than myself, I decided that I would return for the remade order so my teenager would eat tonight as planned. Well.. I drive 10 minutes back and get my remade order and another apology. The worse part about this is I should have cut my losses... but this is the same place that I hosted by friends Bridal shower in the private dining hall and the service was amazing, this is the same place that I have come for happy hours but tonight I should have said NO!!

It just seemed like they were full size beds and not queens.  Also the bathroom vanity seemed a tad bit oversized for the space.  It felt cramped while using the bathroom.  There isn't much room to move around in the bathroom, and with the vanity and the door in close proximity it would make one feel claustrophobic.  Other than that it was nice.

"IF YOU ARE FEMALE & YOUNG, GO SOMEWHERE ELSEI dropped off my car and told them I needed my oil change. They were very friendly and said they would have it done quickly, which was appreciated. When I came back to pick up my car three hours later, they charged me $75 dollars for the oil change. The guy working the counter could tell I was shocked (an oil change at the dealer usually costs $35).  He explained they had used synthetic oil. When I asked why they would give me synthetic oil when I didn't ask for it, he gave me some BS answer that it was standard for Toyotas. Since he could tell I was upset, he said they were running a special and knocked down the price by 25%. I am aware that I am a young woman and that I don't know much about cars but I do not appreciate being taken advantage of. I will be going elsewhere for car maintenance from now on.Wish I had read the reviews before trying out this Firestone.

"Walked in on a quiet Wednesday night, where only three other tables were occupied.  We should've walked out right then and there, but we figured it was just a mid-week lull.This is not an exaggeration, but FIVE MINUTES after we ordered, our food came out.  At least they could've *pretended* they were cooking our food to order, rather than simply reheating leftovers.Our dish of complimentary cornbread was bone-dry.  Perhaps it had been drenched in honey butter a day or two prior, but it certainly hadn't seen any moisture that day.Our gumbo was cold on top but piping hot on the bottom, so we mixed up the bowl to get a lukewarm appetizer.Based on other Yelpers' reviews about the ""tough"" creole rabbit, Olivier's preys on people who have never eaten rabbit before.  We've cooked numerous rabbit dishes at home and know how tender it can be.  Again, the rabbit might've been tender at some point, but it was certainly not cooked fresh that day.  It was also cold to the touch, and the accompanying rice pilaf was super dry.All told, we were seated, ordered, fed, paid, and out the door in 35 minutes.Another minus:  Olivier's website shows the creole rabbit priced at $22.95, so you're ready to spend $20ish, but once you're in the restaurant, it's $27.95 and you're spending almost $30 for a reheated plate of mediocre food.The only plus is that the waitress was super nice and made us feel right at home.That wasn't enough to save the experience, though.  I expect to see Olivier's on Gordon Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares soon.",tensor(0),"tensor([0], device='cuda:0')"
"I'm not gonna lie, i consider myself somewhat of a breakfast connoisseur. I'm not saying anybody else considers me this, I'm pretty sure its just me. But regardless of the details i travel long, far, and wide for a good breakfast. My next stop on this adventure was Skyway Jack's, now this isn't the original Skyway, ill make my way to that one at some point. But this one was closer to work and i decided to shoot over and see what all the hype was about. And from my visit the hype was well deserved. Now there were a couple of glitches when i got there, they were down a waitress so one poor soul was stuck working the whole room, and the service suffered because of it. Mainly my omelet came luke warm. I was dissapointed but i took the situation into consideration and decided to give them a pass. When i dug in i was extremely pleased. HOME FRIES, get the HOME FRIES. This is what home fries are suppost to taste like, not bland, and tasteless. These ppl do it right, the omelet was delicious aswell, the hash was good. Was dissapointed at the quality of the biscuit, but aside from that everything was pretty wonderful. Now its not at the level of Kissin Cuzzins, or Frog Pond. Who at the moment i consider the mecca's of Pinellas County breakfast. But its just a notch below. 4 stars for Skyway, def worth checking out. They also have some cheaper breakfast options for those not wanting to spend $7 on an omelet. We can't all be high rollers like me.........lol",tensor(1),"tensor([0], device='cuda:0')"

We sat at the bar area. The two gentlemen working the bar were extremely helpful and welcoming. They explained the menu to us. Everything is cooked fresh.  We love spicy food. The hotter the better; the food was so amazingly flavorful I would drive back from Washington, DC just to eat here again. I had the Cumin Pork spiced to level 10 my friend had chicken fried rice. We like very hot food most places even in DC cannot get the balance of heat and flavor right even when dishes are request extra spicy. Han Dynasty did!!

"Don't waste your money at Concord Pet Supply. I bought two dog beds from them, one large and one small. The small bed was folded together between a stack of beds. I thought this will work for my MinPin. After bringing home and realizing that it wouldn't fit him and that the bed continues to fold back in on itself, never standing up properly, I thought I'd go back and exchange it for a larger one that was a different style. I didn't even have the unused bed for 24hrs when I went back to do an exchange. I was told that they don't do pet bed returns, which no one tells you about when you purchase it, but rather is on the last line on the receipt, which no one reads. The bed wasn't used, the sale wasn't 24hrs old, and I was told that I was shit out of luck. Rather than explain to me and allow me to exchange for a larger bed that cost more, I was turned away. Not very hospitable or customer friendly. Save your money and go down the street to Pet Supply Store where they are much more friendly, on average a few dollars cheaper, and willing to work with the customer when they have an issue.

"Sbraga: good, but not great. I dined here on a Saturday evening and ordered the four course tasting menu with some friends. We were seated promptly and the service was great. I ordered the fried green tomatoes with smoked shortbreads and cumin aioli, sea bream with rustic bread salad and hummus, meatloaf with bacon marmalade and the chocolate mousse taste with pistachio ice cream. My first two courses were excellent. It was my first time eating shortbreads, and I was pleasantly surprised. The sea bream dish was light and very tasty. However, I felt things fell short with the meat course and the dessert. The texture of the meatloaf was too crumbly, and I think I prefer my meatloaf to be a little more solid. It also seems that they included olives in their bacon marmalade and the taste of the marmalade was just too vinegary for me. And as for the dessert, it was just ok. I was able to taste the other desserts my friends ordered, and I was not really impressed by them, either. Also of note, almost every dish that came out was liberally garnished with dill-not that I mind dill, but after the third course, that was a lot of dill. Overall, it was a good meal. But for $49 dollars, I don't know if I would necessarily come back.",tensor(0),"tensor([1], device='cuda:0')"

"I love this place!  At first, I was a little worried because I'm not a fan of spicy food and I was told that Sichuan cuisine differs a little from the Chinese cuisine most people might be accustomed to but I loved it.  We had a waiter who was Chinese who gave us a lot of good information and was able to alter some dishes for us so for those who do not like their dishes too spicy or can't handle a lot of heat, do not worry, because it seems as though they can alter the spiciness to most of their dishes.  We were told which dishes that they were known for and which dishes are ""traditional"" so we tried the Dan Dan Noodles with less spice and it was delicious!  We were also recommended the Double Cooked Pork Belly, which is something I don't usually like because it's kind of fatty, but it turned out to be great as well.  They also have a cool little happy hour with some cheaper drinks so it's cool to get there a little before dinner, like we did and enjoy some cheaper drinks before dinner.  I wish they had some light beer available since I'm a girl and I'd like to have some lower calorie/lighter options for beer, but it's okay since they have a good wine selection too so I just chose to go with wine.  The food is relatively affordable, it's not Chinatown cheap, but it's not expensive either.  Overall, it was a very delicious meal in a fun, comfortable environment.

My two year old played there for 3 hours between the splash pad and playground, and would have stayed longer if I let her.

Rice was overcooked to the point it was unrecognizable. It was mush. There was no curry. It taste more like a bland Indian dish which I have never had. The spices were there but there was no salt. The dosa was mushy. It was disgusting! Next stop K-TOWN KOREAN FRIED CHICKEN: $8 for 4 chicken wings supposedly cooked Korean Style. Save your time and your money and go straight to Cafe Soho! The wings were breaded and there was more breading than chicken. What a let down. Then on to THE COW AND THE CURD: $14 for gloriFRIED cheese and a frozen lemonade. It was a fancier version of a mozzarella stick. Sadly enough this is what I enjoyed the most. What left the bitter tast in my mouth from the visit to this truck?

With 10 additional men in the wedding spanning 3 different states, it was extremely convenient for everybody to handle their tux at whatever location was most convenient for them.  Having any one of the other 10 tuxes be compromised in any way (wrong fit, dirty, damaged, missing pieces, etc.) would be an inconvenience and obviously not ideal for a wedding that you pay huge bucks for everything to be perfect.  During the 2 months leading up to the wedding all 11 men went in and got fitted on time with only a few of them needing alterations or different sizes, my husband's being one of them (just one piece of the tux was wrong).  The rest of the guys picked theirs up with no problem, which left them to screw up the one tux that actually mattered most.  When my husband went in the day before the wedding to pick up his tux they couldn't give it to him because they didn't have it.  With only one piece of the tux needing to be replaced earlier in the week, they somehow managed to lose or send out the whole tux.  My husband mentioned that they weren't even very apologetic about it, just that that was that and they'd overnight the tux so that it was to them by the morning.  Our wedding was a couple hours away so my husband had to miss out on a couple things with some of our family and friends because he had to wait at home to pick up his tux the morning of our wedding and then drive all the way to the where our wedding in time for the photographer, etc.  Fast forward a couple weeks and we get a card in the mail ""Congratulations on your wedding.  I personally would like to thank you for choosing Men's Wearhouse for your special day.  From all of us here, good luck and congratulations!"" - ""Jason"".  I instantly take notice to 2 very obvious things....  1-) Where's the apology? And 2-) The 12 year old chicken scratch that wrote the card was not Jason, the person who signed it.  Different print, different color ink.  ""I PERSONALLY would like to thank you...."" ....not so personal anymore is it?Somewhat of a slap in the face that they didn't somehow take note to their screw up and at least follow up with us via a phone call to make sure everything went well and to offer an apology.  Also a slap in the face that Jason Hartley, an ""Operations Manager"", couldn't even write a card himself, given the circumstances.  To say I'm annoyed by this, would be an understatement.  I WILL say, however, that Jason is lucky my husband didn't tell me about all of this until after the tux was in hand and en route to the wedding (and on time) the morning of our wedding because otherwise, he wouldn't have gotten off so easily.",tensor(0),"tensor([1], device='cuda:0')"

"We dropped by 21st Amendment for some late-night cocktails in French Quarter without going to the rowdier spots. Given that this was close to where we were staying (the Marriott), it was easy to pop out and roll over to 21st Amendment, which was only a few minutes away. There wasn't a line outside, but it was packed by the time we made it inside (sometime between 10-11 PM)...standing-room only, with the seats at the high-top tables and the bar taken. The decor and ambiance is a bit more retro, but like all New Orleans spots in this fashion, it feels homey, and it was enhanced by the fact that the band in the bar playing live music was absolutely entrancing the audience, with some folks even doing some dancing right at the front.That said, I did come here initially because it was rated highly for drinks, and on that front, the cocktails do not disappoint. The bartenders make the drinks expertly, whether you stay on-menu or stray off by giving some general preferences. The beer selection is more generic, with specific bottles being the big-label brands, and no names given for listings like 'seasonal' or 'IPA'. Nonetheless, the drinks are made quickly but consistently - something I appreciated given how busy it was that night. Pricing was reasonable, relatively speaking - $13 a cocktail is a bit expensive, but the quality was very good, making it a bargain compared to some places in New York that I have been to.21st Amendment really has a nice cozy feel to it, and with great drinks and great music, it's hard to go wrong. It doesn't have the kind of 'fun' you'd find half a block over on Bourbon Street, but at my age, it's the kind of fun that I'd rather have. Definitely worth a visit if you are in the area.",tensor(1),"tensor([1], device='cuda:0')"
"You know the place must have good food when the average BMI of their patrons is 42. South Jersey has diners galore... which one to choose? WHICH ONE TO CHOOOOOSE?!?! Oh the options! Picked Meadow's Diner based on the reviews and was not disappointed. Came in at 10:30ish on a Saturday morning and while busy, I was still seated promptly and with a smile. Service was slightly lacking for refills on water but heeeeeey! It's JERSEY. I had the French Toast w/ Italian Sausage (which was homemade and very authentic [not to mention spicy]). The French Toast was fluffy but a bit cold. Boyfriend had some sort of artery clogging omelet which was very tasty but I'm sure it was about 5,000 calories (heeeeeeey! it's JERSEY!).

"We gave this place a second try, at the request of a family member. We went to dinner on a Sunday night, as  a party of 6. This time the appetizers were all in stock, and the only thing they were out of was sweet potato fries - not a big deal. We ordered the charcuterie plate and the brussels sprouts for appetizers and they were both great. The only critique I had is that the charcuterie plate came with three cheeses, two meats, and only five small pieces of bread. We immediately asked for more bread, but didn't receive it until our group had eaten 95% of the platter.I was again disappointed in the dinner. Of the 6 entrees on the menu, four were seafood, one was lamb, and one was beef. Two of us ordered the exact same thing - the 6 ounce beef filet, done medium. One of us received medium, while I received well done. This is twice I've received well done when ordering medium. Another member of our party ordered the Depot burger, and didn't receive it until 20 minutes after the rest of our food was brought out, despite everyone ordering at the same time. We made it known that it was unacceptable for him to have to sit there for twenty minutes, while the rest of us had been served. We were finished with our meals by the time his food arrived. I don't know if this was an issue with the kitchen, or with our order not being put in correctly, but I will note that our server wrote nothing down. The only saving grace for this place is their bar, with their refreshing and delicious cocktails. Everyone was pleased with their selections, and multiple rounds were ordered. I wish the dining experience lived up to the bar experience, but I don't think we will be giving this place a third chance.",tensor(0),"tensor([1], device='cuda:0')"
"My boyfriend and I arrived at Don Pablo's at 5:45 on Saturday night. We were told the wait was 30 minutes- awesome. After 45 minutes passed, we checked in with the hostess again.

The manager took us to our table, again no apology- just explained that this happens a lot.After being seated, our server came 15 minutes later for our drink order. No introduction, just ""What do you want to drink."" After ordering a margarita and beer, we waited another 10 minutes for our drinks to arrive.I regret our appetizer of flauetas or whatever they are called. Frozen taquitos that were rock hard when they arrived at my table. After the appetizer, it took 35 minutes for our entrees to reach the table. My boyfriends was cold and mine was incorrect.

It does not have as many varieties for Veggies, the Nann was cold & stale, the soup container was empty.In previous visits, the staff was very friendly and accommodating.

"I really want to love this place and give it a full 5 stars but just cannot due to one major flaw in their menu. The pita at this place is ALL WRONG, it's too fluffy and soft, almost like a pita shaped version of wonder bread and it ruins their Shawarma sandwiches. Real pita has some structure and chew to it but unfortunately Naf Naf doesn't make it this way and what ends up happening is you have a soggy mess of a pita sandwich that literally falls apart in your hands within the first few bites. I also feel that you don't really get very much food for the money; they are Subway-stingy with the meat and a smallish pita sandwich and drink with a small cup of rice or fries for 12 bucks is disappointing. The Halal Guys across town give you a huge amount of food in their platters for less than that.",tensor(0),"tensor([0], device='cuda:0')"

"This is a cool looking new restaurant with friendly service, but the food isn't great.I like the idea of a multicultural menu, so I wanted to try Global A'fare out.  I liked the outdoor eating area.  I also thought there were a lot of good looking cocktails on the menu.Our waiter was very nice and enthusiastic about the menu, but he wasn't very good.  He forgot or misheard some of our orders.We started with the global tasting tour.  We had the prosciutto, the hard salami and the tyrokafteri.  The tyrokafteri was pretty good.  I would pass on the meats.  Both were extremely salty.  I would call the prosciutto closer to baked ham than a cured delicacy.  For my main course, I tried the meatballs.  The meatballs had the same super salty ""prosciutto"" in them, so they were insanely salty.  The marinara sauce was bland.  My husband had the pastitsio, which he did not like.  Our friend had the limoncello chicken which he really enjoyed.For dessert, we had the fried baklava with ice cream.  That was not very good baklava.The cocktails we had were pretty darned tasty.

"This just isn't A-OK. It's just not. I wish it were. Alas... it's getting 3 stars for balance. 2 stars seems harsh for a random act of poor service (plus, once the lead server / bartender recognized negligence he took care of the situation). Why are there only two servers handling an entirely packed Friday lunch hour? If we cracked the books on human lunch behavior I'd guess that we'd see a spike in pizza eating on Fridays (lower stress) and Mondays (higher stress). I'd imagine that'd it be a good thing to always have extra staff on hand at any lunch spot downtown -- especially one that offers beer, sports, and pizza -- and especially one that has slowly built a pretty solid foundation for itself in just under a year. Alas... we waited. And waited. I could go on & on about how we waited. The saving grace? Sun King's Oktoberfest on draft touching my stomach. Once that happened... the business is guaranteed 3 stars. What's that Jon? Why? Well.. think about it. This business has the choice every day to serve swill or serve local suds. At the end of every day they consider the beer they have to put in an order for. They've maintained their commitment to local beer (probably because people are finally drinking it). With that, you're A-OK friend (or at least until SKB takes over every single bar in the city or they start serving their suds at a mortuary that's posing as a pub -- sure a cool thought but think about it...). However... please note that the longer you make me wait for pizza the higher the expectations are. Unlike when you make me wait for Sun King beer and then I have it, I know it will be great, I don't know for sure what this pizza will be like. Yes I ate it. Yes I generally liked it -- but that's because I generally like cheese, bread, cooked cheese on cooked bread (really, I'd eat any version of it, anywhere, anytime). Nevertheless, it just wasn't all that riveting (and yes when I'm eating pizza I want to be riveted like I'm watching Kirstie Alley woo Patrick Dempsey in Can't Buy Me Love). On a blustery day, a beer and cooked cheese and bread is perfect. I love walking in that alley. In fact, I close my eyes and think of the way this alley looked in 1907, and I especially close my eyes when I walk through the odd purgatory chamber of an office building hallway that you have to get through to get to the pub.

Prices are reasonable and food quality is outstanding. Location is easy to find and convenient if you're on the south side.Why the minus one star?

"Loved Penang during my time in Boston, so I was excited to see one in Philly's chinatown! Quality of the food was about the same too. The menu is fairly diverse, and offers a variety of thai, malaysian, indian and chinese dishes. Definitely try the roti canai, probably the most ordered item in the restaurant. You get a huge blanket of roti, wrapped artfully into a sculpture. It is only a couple millimeters thick and strikes a perfect balance between crispiness and chewiness. It goes great with the accompanying curry sauce, which also contains some pieces of chicken and potato. I also tried out the indian mee goreng on my most recent visit. It certainly had a lot of taste and went well with the other dishes I ordered, but a warning that there is a strong seafood taste (they use dried squid sauce).Another favorite of mine is the beef rendang. The beef is super tender and the curry sauce it is cooked in is delicious - tastes of coconut milk and lemongrass, with hints of cinnamon. Order a bowl or two of rice to go with this!Finally, I would order the spareribs malaysian style. These pork shortribs are lightly fried, but the meat is juicy and goes really well with the accompanying sweet and sour sauce!

The chef later told us that the mushrooms had been recently gathered by forager in rural Pennsylvania who had to sleep out in his car for two nights. The effort was worth it, we really enjoyed.We shared a middle course of slow cooked tuna and then moved onto a steak and a chicken for our main course.

"This place is absolutely delightful. I am seldom able to sneak to this part of the city, but when I do and the hour is right, I rush here. The macrons are always to die for, each melting in your mouth (even after sitting in the quaint box for a few days). The Darkness Croissant is my favorite but so rich it takes multiple sittings to consume. The Harry Potter themed desserts brought me in yesterday where I purchased a few specialties. The Tonk's Chouquette was beautiful and light with a fun cherry center. The pumpkin pasties went great with a cup of tea. I have the Molly's Meat Pie ready to go for my lunch today. Honestly, I could have gotten one of each of the new treats if my budget allowed it.Overall, this place makes my day each time I visit. Staff is friendly and the atmosphere is elegant.

We stopped in after picking my friend up at the airport. I should have read the reviews before hand as we experienced the SAME ISSUES on undercooked steaks! I should have known it was going to happen as the server asked us to cut into our steak while she waited. Both were supposed to be medium and they came out blue rare!! Now we have cut into them so all the juices exit the meat and upon re-cooking the steaks became dry. During our meal I noticed the table next to us had sent back their steaks as well due to under cooking!Does a national chain not have the ability to properly cook a steak??? I think not........,tensor(0),"tensor([1], device='cuda:0')"
"Quite possibly the perfect business model to fail if it wasn't for a sequestered clientel?  We visit New Orleans often, and it is an activity of ours to bet on how many beers or ingredients they are out of.  Bartenders rude and swearing. It's almost comical, we sit and listen to patrons asking for draft beers and mixed drinks and getting responses ""can't do that"".  They said ""No mules"", to at least 5 people as we sat for about 30 mins today.  2 out of 4 taps not working. What an absolute waste of opportunity.",tensor(0),"tensor([1], device='cuda:0')"

"As I grow in disenchantment with each passing day in this city, I desperately needed to find something worthy of praise.  My positive childhood memories of Edmonton were being marred by modern reality.  I was almost apprehensive in returning to the local science center that I had loved so much.  It had been so long, I had a full head of hair back then and this place was called the Edmonton Space and Science Centre.  I considered turning around and returning to the car, allowing my memories to remain untarnished, but the girlfriend encouraged me further.  And good thing to, because the TELUS Science World is still amazing.  I returned to my youth, ready and willing to being enveloped in the science I fell in love with, the science that awoke me to the truths of the world.  Not going to lie, I felt a little out of place...the majority of the exhibits are for children, and despite wanting to channel my inner-toddler, I was forced to avoid them.  However, I still must praise the polish of the exhibits themselves, especially one particular display of an active representation of stellar bodies by projecting video upon a spherical surface.  The illusion was fantastic in recreating the Earth, Sun, Moon, and Mars, only slightly marred when my towering frame walked in front of a projector.  The permanent exhibits are appealing, and I appreciated that old wireframe moon lander simulator was still here after thirty years.  Damn you girlfriend for making me remain an adult.  I wanted to play!  No, I don't want to leave early.  I never wanted to be a child again more, not that I needed much of an excuse to act like one.  Hell, I've always considered myself just a cheap facsimile of an adult poorly controlled by an immature mind fumbling over controls, ever vigilante for those brief moments when no one was looking in order to play with toys again.  Perhaps my positive experience was fortified by the seasonal feature, Dinosaurs Unearthed.  For those who need reminding, Dinosaurs are always awesome in any form they take, scientifically accurate or not.  Whatever device you employ, be it genetic cloning, time travel, or alien transplantation, there's no reason dinosaurs should not be included in a story.  I always though E.R. would've been more interesting if George Clooney had been replaced by a diplodocus.  You would think considering our visit was a mere three days after touring the Royal Tyrrell Museum, that I would've been tired of dinosaurs, but clearly you don't appreciate the appeal of giant lizards roaming the Earth millions of years before man.  I think that fact alone is what turned me away from religion...well, that and Star Trek.  Man they need to put dinosaurs in Star Trek.  Well, I guess there was the Gorn, but that hardly--ahem, where was I.  Right.  In fact, the variations between the two exhibits is worth noting.  At Royal Tyrrell, the majority of exhibits were skeletons, while the exhibits at the TELUS Science World were animatronic representations of living animals--beautiful, colored, feathered dinosaurs.  That alone should be enough of a draw, but no, because The Margaret Zeidler Theatre is still functioning.  One of the largest and coolest dome theaters you're ever likely to see, the Margaret Zeidler Theatre is the dominant reason I come to Science World, and now soon to be the only real reason to visit Edmonton in its entirety.  If allowed, I would sit for every film, twice even.  I miss the old Zeiss optical-mechanical projector--that thing in the center that looked like the chaos gate-creating warp drive from Event Horizon.  Alas, the increasing failure and cost of parts, and the efficiency of digital projectors made maintaining the old goliath uneconomical, but it didn't appear to affect the resulting experience.  The Digital Universe film almost brought me to tears given its epic scope and masterful presentation.  Unlike the IMAX film, you can watch as many dome shows as you wish.  Our ticket actually included the aforementioned IMAX, so we opted for the must-see Walking with Dinosaurs Prehistoric Planet 3D, a shortened and unequivocally superior variation to the feature film massacred by 20th Century Fox by adding annoying and unnecessary voice overs.  It's a damned shame this version is not available for purchase.  I am going to miss the TELUS Science World, as it was the only spot worth visiting in Edmonton.  Although still remarkable, and remaining the top of a very short-list of places to visit in Edmonton, it's simply not enough for me to make the diversion in future trips.  Thank you TELUS Science World for influencing my childhood and remaining steadfast in your quality against the depreciating value of the city around.  I could finally be a kid again.",tensor(1),"tensor([1], device='cuda:0')"

Jones brunch is amazing. Went with four friends and we got the all got bottomless Bellinis which is a great deal. They let it sit there for 2 hours while we drank as much as we could. The mac and cheese is to die for. Monkey bread is a great appetizer for the table. Chicken and Waffles was really good. Chicken was moist and and the skin was gently fried.

"After reading a lot of positive reviews, we were really excited to try this place. We were extremely disappointed in the food. I'm going to give the place the benefit of the doubt that it is not always like this as we came in at 10 PM, but if you cannot offer quality food at that hour then don't have your kitchen open. All of our food came out within 5 to 10 minutes of ordering which leads me to believe it was not made fresh. The Caesar salad was room temperature and overdressed. The hush puppies were flavorless, and the chicken wings (3 full wings is a serving) were undercooked and barely warm. The only redeeming food item was the chicken and biscuits, which had a nice flavor profile- the biscuit was again, cold in spots. On the positive side the place has a nice hip atmosphere and the service is friendly. Unfortunately, the food was so sub par we would not consider dining here again.",tensor(0),"tensor([1], device='cuda:0')"

We were standing at the door for a good 5 minutes before we were even acknowledged.  It took even longer for someone to come by and take our order. They couldn't even get the order right. The bean sprouts, mint, and lemons we had to ask for and trying to get their attention was pretty painful. It took another table across from us to get the server's attention to get these and forks for my kids.I have never not tipped (usually no less than 10%), but these guys really made me consider not tipping at all...2 stars because the food was passable.",tensor(0),"tensor([0], device='cuda:0')"
"Love love love their pizza!!!!!  We went there for the first time tonight. We started with the honey buffalo wings. This is probably the only reason they got 4 and not 5 stars. The wings were on the small side. Aside from that they were not crispy and I didn't taste any honey in the sauce. I'd probably order them again but make sure you specify extra crispy. The pizza however, was awesome. I got the Parma. I made sure they added the arugula AFTER the pizza was cooked. It was so good that even though I'm stuffed I can't wait until I'm hungry again so I can enjoy my leftovers!  They also had a twisted pretzel beer that tasted like a pretzel!!!  It was so good and not heavy even though it was a dark beer. Make sure to go next door and get some gelato for dessert.",tensor(1),"tensor([1], device='cuda:0')"
Wings are amazingly flavorful! I love their beer selection as well... I would say the only negative is how small their menu is.

"Decided to try this out for a late morning Sunday brunch option.  Tried the classic breakfast, a nest egg and a hand squeezed OJ.  Firstly - super excited about housemade biscuits.  Its really shocking to me that very few places bother to do this.  Gravy was tasty, but could have used a little more.  Now, in all fairness, I treat gravy like an entree as opposed to an accompaniment, so for ""normal"" folk, you may find the gravy quantity acceptable.  I went with bacon, which was really good - thick slices, nice and crispy.  And my eggs were cooked perfectly to order.  I really liked the crispy potatoes, as well.  Two, small whole potatoes, well seasoned and seared on the outside.  The OJ was fresh and tasty - not too tart. My friend had the nest egg.  She thought it was really tasty, but since I didn't try it, I don't have much to say about that. I think the food is excellent.  I will agree with other reviews - not a fan of the community seating.  We didn't have an issue finding a seat and people did move along quickly, but since folks tend to want to catch up over a meal, you don't really have the privacy or the space to do that here.  I am hoping the excellent food results in more seating!!",tensor(1),"tensor([1], device='cuda:0')"
"Good sushi, slow service and moderately expensive. They did bring us free edamame because of our wait and couldn't have been nicer. We had 3 rolls, 2 hot sake, 3 beers for $60. The big Sapporo was $10. The edamame was awesome, the philly roll was awesome as is the standard, the spicy tuna was good and the dragon roll wasn't for me, I didn't enjoy it. For two people I felt the meal was worth about $40-$45 not the $60 we paid. I will probably try somewhere else the next time I get a hankering for sushi. The decor is plain and simple, a few large tables, people sit together, it wasn't too crowded. Nice people, good food, a bit overpriced. I wouldn't not recommend it but it's not the greatest. I'd give it 2.5 stars if I could but I'll err on the nice side",tensor(0),"tensor([0], device='cuda:0')"
Although the food here is good and have tried their buffet couple of times - one word of caution dont order here from grub hub and then expect your order to be ready when you go for pick up- as i found out yesterday.

"This review is for the Laura/OakAlley plantation tour. The tours were great but the company can't take any credit. It's the tour guides at the plantation that are So Great! This company has POOR time management issue! After being picked up, we waited for about 20min to wait for the other bus to come then about 20 people were transferred to our bus. By the time we really started the tour, it was an hour after the pick up time. Payment issue - I called about the discount I'll get if I reserve online. The woman told me to do it otherwise I can't get it when paying in person. So I did it. But, then the driver, half way into the tour, said now everyone please line up to pay. He used a tiny portable credit card machine to process everyone's card. It was slow  SLOW! The bus was full that day and it was 90 degrees out. It took him about 45min to get everything done plus he was confused about two groups of people who happened to have the same last name. Really? It's 2013 people! The company can't take payment online or over the phone?  Why ask your customer to waste valuable time? Though I had the email proving I've paid online. I was told that it simply reserved my seats and wasn't the actual payment. So paid AGAIN and of course got charged TWICE! It has been over a week and I haven't got the refund. Because of this delay, when we got to the second plantation, we had about a little over an hour left because the driver said we  must leave at 5.  He told us to go straight to the big house but gave us the WRONG time when the tour would start. So everyone waited about 15 minutes in line AGAIN instead of just enjoying the beautiful garden at Oak Alley. (The tour is boring and the stories aren't interesting. I'd recommend people just spend all the time in the garden) By the time we came out, it was almost time to get on the bus and head back to the French Quarter. So Disapppinting. We didn't get to visit the beautiful Oak Alley at all. Give me my money back, Cajun Encounter!",tensor(0),"tensor([0], device='cuda:0')"

"High hopes.. Big let down. Let's start with service. Once seated we waited considerably longer then expected for our server. She was pleasant but admittedly running ""very behind"". The menu was delightful and the items sounded delicious. I ordered the chicken fried steak. My wife had the tacos. She said they were fine, but she is not into food like I am. Then again how do you mess up tacos? Although, she did admit the filling was far too wet and caused the corn tortilla to fall apart. She was not unhappy and enjoyed her meal. Now on to my dish, the Chicken Fried Steak. Great idea poor delivery. The steak was an oily mess, the English muffin was cold and very obviously not toasted correctly. The scrambled eggs seemed out of a carton. I served in the Navy, and these eggs must have been manufactured at the same place. Now my biggest let down of the meal... The massively hyped potatos.. they were so awful. If I had to guess these were out of a bag and deep fried. At least half tasted like they had sat under a warming light to the point of fossilizing.  They were hard dry and way to salty.. The check came in at roughly 60 bucks. Not worth the money. Totaly missed the mark.",tensor(0),"tensor([0], device='cuda:0')"

"Great breakfast spot. Forget to check-in a lot, but have been coming here for months now. Recommend the biscuits instead of toast. They are delicious.

The scrapple is great, so are the breakfast potatoes.Today  I had the grilled pastrami on rye with Swiss and 1,000 dressing. The only thing missing is some sauerkraut. It would be so much better.The only breakfast dish I haven't been thrilled about is the sausage biscuit with gravy. The reason is because it's a sausage patty on an amazing biscuit.

"Well, well.... Where do I start with this place? First time experience, went in with my partner.Walking in at about 7:30 on a Friday night (st paddys day weekend even)  and the  place had about 4 customers. That should have been my first clue as to what our experience was going to be like.We seated ourselves and the waitress, an older gal maybe mid to late 40's who had greasy stringy unwashed hair and rotting teeth came up and took our drink order. My girlfriend got a Dr. Pepper and I got a water. She brought out Coke instead of DP. No biggie. We let it go, assuming it was an honest mistake. After about 10 minutes she returns and we order a 12 piece ""jumbo"" wing basket ($11.99), a 6 piece($7.99), and a beer batter sampler($11.99). 20 minutes pass and finally here comes our appetizer. The waitress throws the basket of appetizers on the table  and says ""here's your food."" Very flat with a big attitude and walks off. The beer battered mushrooms were doughy and undercooked. We had a single half full ranch cup to share between us for the big platter and she avoided our table when she saw we needed more.***let me note that this waitress is giving the customers at the 3 tables surrounding us WAY better customer service. Even brought their food out in a timely manner with no attitude whatsoever.I decide to let the mushrooms slide for the moment. I used to work in a restaurant and I understand that mistakes happen, however this far into the experience I'm being mighty generous since it's a first time experience.We finish our appetizer and we wait and wait and wait and finally she comes by and takes the platter returning 10 minutes later with our wings. She makes no inquiry about the broken open, clearly undercooked, mushrooms still sitting on the platter.I got the 12 piece with a single half full ranch. Again. Food on the table, doesn't ask if we need anything else which is something she is doing for other customers. at this point we have been here for about 40 minutes.I got half regular and half thai flavor. The wings were NOT jumbo. They were puny. The flavor was good for the thai, and the waitress even stopped by to check up on us, though I wouldn't consider walking by quickly and saying in your flat attitude tone ""youguysdoingalright?okaycool."" Really all that helpful since she came and went so fast it took me a second to understand her. I had to reiterate for my girlfriend.  When I started on the regular I bit into my drumstick and had to fish a feather out of my mouth. DISGUSTING. It was that point that the entire experience was completely and thoroughly unacceptable.  The wings were soggy because they batter them or something on top of all that.  At first I had no plans other than to pay for the meal and leave the waitress 2 pennies and be on my merry way. But when the waitress came and asked if we needed a box I said no with 6 wings still on my plate, OBVIOUS SOMETHING WAS WRONG, again. She was going to take my stuff and make no inquiry to right the situation. I asked for the manager. Took a minute but finally the manager came over (mind you it is still pretty dead, what are these people doing I wonder?) I explained the food issues but blew off bringing up our treatment by the waitress. Normally I give the benefit of the doubt on this one but it was blatantly obvious that we were being treated differently with a different attitude than other patrons because we are a same-sex couple. Like our table had a contagious disease that prevented us from getting food in a timely manner, and getting drink and condiment refills too, regardless of the *empty* cups on the edge of the table. It wasn't like we were off in the distance. She had to walk by our table every time to communicate with the surrounding tables.Anyways. The manager experience wasn't the greatest, but I wasn't going to pay for that meal after the feather thing, and she comped everything. BUT only after slightly arguing with us about the undercooked mushrooms, which by the way come frozen which  makes the fact that they weren't cooked all the way acceptable I guess? Don't know. Don't care. I WILL NOT BE GOING BACK!!!2 stars because they did comp the meal, the waitress got lucky. If I would have had to pay for anything she wouldn't have gotten a tip due to the attitude but we left her $4 anyway since we didn't have to pay for the meal.  THAT IS THE ONLY REASON.1 star though for the overall experience. Same-sex couples, steer clear. You aren't welcome there and it's obvious.",tensor(0),"tensor([0], device='cuda:0')"

I ended up with two delicious flavors -- Red Velvet and Strawberry Sangria in a waffle cone! The decor was super cute-- chalk boards with flavors written on there in a colorful fashion, and hand made drawings were dangled about. The fill of fresh made waffle cones also permeated the air, really riles up the sweet tooth in a person.

I think this hotel needs to instill some sort of quiet hours if it wants to set themselves in the genre of classy.

"I tried to like this place... I really did. So much so that I went back to try it after a less that satisfactory first wax.Wax 1- I had Despina, I think her name was. I waited a good 15 minutes after my appointment time for her to come and get me from the front. Ironic they have a 9 minute policy that if you don't show they'll cancel/charge you or whatever. Anyway, as for the experience with Despina, she did not speak to me. Like at all. Made me feel super awkward the whole time, and missed a fair few chunks of hair. She didn't ask me anything about myself, didn't tell me where to sit or how she wanted me positioned etc. Luckily I got this one half price as it was my first time at EWC.Wax 2- I booked 3-4 weeks later with Amy Jo (based on previous Yelp reviews). She was a lot friendlier (literally the only reason why I'm giving this 1 star) BUT way too sloppy. I think it's safe to say this is the worst wax I've ever had. She left half of my hair on right before Valentine's Day! I understand they can't get all the hairs all the time but a lottttt of hair right on top was left clearly visible to my waxer. My apt was at 3.45, I walked out of the building at 3.53. Really. This includes the time spent undressing, redressing, and paying. 8 minutes is not long enough for all of this. It went so quick that when she said she was done I was actually shocked.  I'm about to go to CVS and get some at home wax strips to finish the job... For $47+ I expect way way more. The staff- Another reason why I won't be returning. The ladies at the front desk are generally rude and disinterested in showing any glimpse of good customer service.

"This place is great, flavorful Italian food, beautifully prepared and presented without being fussy.Took the parents and ladyfriend for dinner last weekend.  It wasn't super crowded at 6:30 pm when we arrived so I got a little nervous.  I needn't have feared though; by the time we finished dinner at 9:30 (more about that later) the place was packed.  I guess it's just one of those places where people dine later in the evening.Our server was excellent.  Very attentive without being obtrusive.  He described all of the specials on the extensive list by memory, speaking slowly and clearly rather than spouting them off in a Micro Machines voice like some waitstaff tend to do.  To start we had the grilled polenta with broccoli de rabe, mussels in tomato broth, and the grilled eggplant.  All three were exceptional.  My favorite was the eggplant; it could not have been prepared any more perfectly, and I'm not even a huge eggplant fan.For the main course, I ordered fileted Branzino-as did the ladyfriend-which was prepared in a tomato sauce and served with steamed asparagus.  The fish was melt-in-your-mouth and light yet flavorful.  The asparagus was OK; I prefer asparagus sauteed or grilled.  My dad ordered the fish stew which was also excellent.  My mom ordered veal filet mignon, which I did not taste but judging from her oohs and aahs, was just about perfect.For dessert we just had coffee/cappuccinos, which were very good.  Throughout the 3 hours we sat there, service was excellent .  We never felt rushed at all, despite the restaurant filling up as the night wore on.  My mom remarked that the server waited until we had all finished eating before clearing away any plates (it's a pet peeve of hers when servers take plates away while someone is still eating).  The BYO thing is great, of course.

We were immediately welcomed.  After we filled out their form we were given a tour of the facility and tips and tricks about floating.  We had time to ask as many questions as we needed, although we were all eager to float.Once in your chosen Float chamber room, everything you need is at your disposal (shower gel, shampoo, conditioner, lotion, ear plugs, contact lens case & solution, q-tips, ear plugs, petroleum jelly - used to cover cuts...).  They've thought of everything.You then take your shower and get into the tank.  Immediately you are floating and limitless.The experience was amazing, each of us got something from the experience and we all want to go back.

"I really enjoy this little restaurant full of goodness. Primarily a dessert place, Seasons also serves up some wonderful food dishes which are largely modernized updates on traditional classics. I always enjoy the shaved ice when I come here. The kind Seasons offers is a different type of dessert that I haven't seen anywhere else. The variety of boba tea that they have is also very good. Among my favorite shaved ice are the hula and the koko loco. If you want half and half flavors of shaved ice in your cup there is an additional $1.50 charge for a large size. There are pre-designed concoctions or you could create your own configurations of toppings and flavors. The pre designed concoctions are a better deal.Seasons is situated on the end of a strip mall (across from a large shopping plaza with Regal Cinemas and Marshalls) with plenty of parking. The store itself is clean, bright, and modern and is kid-friendly as there are high hairs available for use. The service has always been friendly, fast, and efficient. Seasons employs an order at the counter, take number, and food is borough out to you when ready model. I can't comment on the food exactly but my boyfriend loves the quail and our friends enjoy the chicken wings which Boon touts as ""the best food item"" there. The quail is small and very flavorful and the wings are a good size and seasoned with five spice which was enjoyed by all. I look forward to many more visits with friends at this location. Check Seasons out and enjoy!",tensor(1),"tensor([1], device='cuda:0')"
Place is empty and there is a 40 minute wait. The problem I have is the snooty attitude of the waitress. Then  after ourlong wait we found out people called in and she said she caught us kissing at the sunset and said how cute we were. Luv her then she showed us to the table before the server came. Which is Tom...was is phenomenal!,tensor(0),"tensor([0], device='cuda:0')"
"Featuring only Canadian ingredients (over 90% of which are sourced in Alberta and BC), the now 11 week old addition to Edmonton's growing 124 St was not far down on my list to eat. Our reservation was for 7pm last Saturday and when we arrived, it was surprisingly not fully seated! A long bar counter actually allows diners to show up without reservations, something I wish I would have known earlier. Large windows made it feel quite open and as the night went on, the dark interior gave it a very trendy atmosphere.To start, I had my mind set on a Caesar, a truly Canadian drink. I didn't even bother to look at the drinks menu (whoops!) and when I ordered, our server Chris kindly told me they had removed it from the menu. Aperol Spritz then? North 53′s mixologist Brendan Brewster (formerly Woodwork, Manor Bistro), happily accommodated my off menu request. Joe and I decided to order off the a la carte versus the $85 tasting meu (lowered from the original opening $100), although many tables were doing so. There's just something about being able to choose what to eat!The ""Various Beets"" has been on the menu for some time now and that's always a sign that it's a winner. Indeed it was. Beets sourced from Riverbend Gardens, done in a multitude of ways: sorbet, pickled, and dehydrated meringue; layered with a goat's cheese mousse, red wine vinaigrette, candied walnuts, and nasturtium (a watercress-like leaf with a peppery taste). Best presentation ever. And incredibly delicious! The beet meringue was the most intriguing, dehydrated to the point that upon contact with moisture (your mouth), it almost dissolved into a burst of beet flavor. What just happened there?!While I was pondering away on the use of a dehydrator, Joe was trying the duck rillette, which he chose from the menu. Similar to a pate, the Fourwhistle Farm's duck was cooked until tender, shredded and formed, topped with pieces of smoked duck breast, and cherry gelee. Gastriqued cherries along with a cherry and hazelnut puree decorated the rest of the plate. Joe loved the gastriqued cherries and both of us enjoyed the smoked duck breast. More of that, please!Sauteed carrots came on top of pearl barley risotto, finished with the Cheesiry's pecorino stock, freshly shaved perocrino, and watercress. Sprinkled over top was a dehydrated brown butter powder, giving the dish another layer of seasoning.The black cod, sourced from Vancouver Island, was done to perfection and supremely moist. Little neck clams and a clam froth were mixed in with the butternut squash puree and roasted butternut squash, although a different server (not Chris) said they were oysters when he brought it out. I really enjoyed this dish and it's because of dishes like these that I'm always keen on ordering a fish entree instead of another protein. I won't know how it compares to the wild boar or milk fed veal sirloin tip until my next visit!I have learnt that two desserts will always make me happier than one and seeing that we were both 80% full, why not. Chris highly recommended the sunchoke ice cream. This dish is definitely not to be missed! Aside from the creative use of sunchoke, it was placed on a thyme sponge, layered with balsamic vinegar curd and more of the brown butter powder, this time with black malt. The ice cream was very well done, smooth, no crystals of ice and had such a pleasant flavor. The thyme sponge had a... spongey texture. Honestly one of the most interesting things to eat, next to the beet meringue we had earlier. Really starting to wonder what kind of dehydrator they're using back there!Our second dessert was the wild blueberry sorbet, accompanying a goat's milk panna cotta. On the bottom were dried blueberries, roasted rolled oats, and a blueberry tuile to anchor the dish. All components were gorgeous, and overall the dish was very unsweetened, which can be a nice way to end a meal. The tarragon granite might not be for all, especially if you do not enjoy licorice! I didn't even know tarragon had that natural taste, it's always mixed in with other herbs when I've had it.Overall, the meal was one of the best that I've ever had. Points all around for presentation, creativity, and taste! It's like an episode on the Food Network. Not only that, the service was excellent and the kitchen was timely with our plates. Chris was extremely knowledgeable on the menu and its ingredients. I had read from some diners that the atmosphere was quite formal, but not so when we went. Quite relaxed in my opinion but they may have eased up, much like the cost of the plates.",tensor(1),"tensor([0], device='cuda:0')"
This is the best pizza in Roxborough!  The ingredients they use are top notch and they have such a variety of specialty pizzas.  I suspect the negative reviews are from competitors worried about their business!  The thin crust reminds me of the pizza I had in Italy.

"I've been here several times for dinner and for breakfast (which is only served Saturday and Sunday.)  The food is always good, the atmosphere can't be beat, but the service is consistently sub-par. I went for breakfast just recently and the food was good, I ordered the french toast, and my wife ordered an omlette.  Both tasty and fairly reasonably priced, at least comparable to what you'd pay anywhere else for a decent breakfast.On to the service:  Somewhere after topping my coffee off a couple times we seemed to be forgotten.  After finishing our meals we proceeded to sit and wait for a couple to-go boxes and our checks for a good 20 minutes.  During which time a couple waiters/bus boys walked past us.  My wife told me to motion for the check, but I don't want to have to do that.  Normally I'm a decent tipper, 25% no problem, but I consistently get poor service here and it's always from the SAME WAITER.  This time I was fed-up it and I left exact change.

"We went to Baileys' Range for the first time this last Wednesday.The restaurant has a decent atmosphere. The ceiling has old stuff hanging from it with a modern architectural flare.Going upstairs I noticed the steps were caked in old compact dirt and grime, it reminded me of a set of dorm stairs. It's a pretty old building but they could have refinished it better.The bathroom upstairs was in decent condition. But, they hadn't dusted in some time and there was quite a bit of dust caked on the water pipes and top of door frame etc.We sat upstairs at a table overlooking the street. Decent view.We started off the meal with a pitcher of their ""boozy"" lemonade for 30 something dollars. I can guarantee there wasn't much ""boozy"" in it. Tasted good but order something else if you want something with alcohol in it.On to the food.It took at least a half hour to get food for 6 people and when we ordered the place was less than half full.The Burger meat had flavor but was dry. For $11 for the burger alone I would expect better.The Chips and sauces were pretty good but small portions.Overall a Meh experience. I won't go back and won't recommend the place to anyone else. In my opinion, they are trying to be an upscale hip burger joint with small portions with a high price tag but the flavor doesn't live up to the expectation.",tensor(0),"tensor([0], device='cuda:0')"

"I took an 8 year old and a 14 year old for the lunch special pizza.  We have done this on several occasions, and the kids love that they each get their own personal pizza, made the way they like.

I was told that they could only get tomato sauce, not BBQ sauce.   I explained that we have gotten it this way several times before.   We were told that they don't offer it this way any more.   I see that some of the pizzas offer BBQ sauce and pointed it out, but again was told that it couldn't be made this way for them.   I asked if I could pay additional to have it made with BBQ sauce, but once again told it was not possible.   Sadly, we left the restaurant and chose a different nearby restaurant for lunch.

Two bags of those and a carton of Russell Stover's milk chocolate marshmallow eggs then I was ready to check out. They make this so easy with plenty of cashiers and they actually like when you use your reusable bags. Yes, I am one of those nuts. I hate plastic bags.

"I thought this was a great addition to downtown St. Pete and was thrilled to have a local place with an extensive selection of spices being that I am a cook. However, the owners are gay hating bigots! This isn't a review on the shop or the product, but a review to let the LGBT community to stay away! I have shopped a few times and each time have been treated differently than the straight people shopping in the shop. The only reason I returned was to make sure my feeling was right. The male owner each time refuses to come from behind the counter to assist me. Its as if he fears he'll catch some disease by talking to a homosexual. Furthermore, I have been there with straight friends and each time have been ignored even though I am the one who need assistance in locating a certain spice. The one time his wife was around she intentionally (and randomly I might add) brought up a conversation about Chick-fil-a and MItt Romney. Again, this isn't a negative review on the shop and its contents but on the owners who cannot refrain from hiding their hatred towards a large part of the Tampa Bay community.

"They have a few locations, and we picked the one that is in more of a residential area than a busy center of the city. There was no line when we arrived shortly after 11am. But, it was still busy, it can get crowded very quickly with a very small interior. They have five counter seats, and that is about it. While we were there, most of them were there to purchase the food to go, so the seats were not in high demand.Even though this is mainly a donut shop, they also offer enticing fried chicken. We ordered their very popular Fried Chicken Sandwich, available from 11am. It was smaller than I thought it would be, but I always take quality over quantity. It was juicy, tasty, with a nice little kick to it. We really enjoyed it!We couldn't just order chicken from a donuts shop, so we got a couple of donuts from their Hot Donuts selections.

Make sure to ask for yum yum sauce to go. The happy hour specials are pretty great. It includes some wine and cocktails along with a few appetizers. You have to sit by the bar area but it has a few TVs so it's entertaining at the least. Another tip- sign up for their mailing list for a $30 off coupon during your birthday month.

Good relationships with neighboring businesses such as restaurants, gyms and parking facilities. Had a reunion weekend with a college roommate, and neither of us are familiar with Philly.  Shawna, the concierge/receptionist, is fantastic!  Her restaurant recommendations were excellent, her customer service skills greatly appreciated, and her invitation to return and contact her directly for help with arrangements seemed 100% sincere. We felt like we made a friend who would remember us at a return visit. She is an asset to this business. Hoping to return with a larger group, as Philadelphia is somewhat of a mid-point geographically. We will certainly consider The Independent for our stay!",tensor(1),"tensor([1], device='cuda:0')"
"Lowe's is our preferred home improvement store. The employees are always super friendly and knowledgeable, not only with helping me find where an item is located, but willing to listen to my project and offer suggestions on how I can get it done.What I really like about this location is their twice-a-month kid's workshops. The kits may be based on kid's movies, but the kids really like that, and the kits are fairly easy to put together. They are made out of real wood and have so far lasted through some heavy playing. The kits have stickers, but the base item can be painted instead, or once the stickers get ruined.I really like that this location sells ""sample size"" paint containers that you can get mixed to whatever color you choose. These 7-8 ounce containers are absolutely perfect for small craft projects (such as painting the resulting toy from the kid's workshop!).You can also have wood and PVC cut by an employee. I've never been charged for the cuts, although my requests have been fairly simple and straightforward. This is especially nice since we don't have any saws at our house, and no place to store any, either.",tensor(1),"tensor([1], device='cuda:0')"

"Native Chicagoans Paulie and Jade are the real deal. This unassuming, tucked away, modest little shop is exactly what you want it to be and more than you would ever expect. Best Chicago dogs in town - hands down! ""Dragged through the garden"" the right way with all real Vienna Beef products and perfectly balanced. Paulie will keep you entertained with lively conversation, especially if you're talking about Chicago, but all the while slicing fresh vegetables for your order. Depending when you show up, you may catch Jade squeezing fresh lemons for a number of fresh lemonade flavors. Some items on the menu are seasonal, but that's ok because everything is prepared fresh and tastes great, and their prices are so low, you can afford to try it all. Next time you want a real Chicago Dog or an authentic Italian Beef (hot & wet, loaded with giardiniera) and want them to exceed your expectations, don't drive out of the way to stand in the cattle call at Portillo's, come see Paulie and Jade because it is better in every way.",tensor(1),"tensor([1], device='cuda:0')"

"If you are looking for a good, fresh, satisfying meal then this place will meet your needs.  If you are a pizza snob looking for the best pie, then you should probably go somewhere else.  I started with the pear and gorgonzola salad which was crisp, fresh, and rather tasty.  My entree was a personal size pepperoni pizza that was good.  The tomato sauce, pepperoni, and cheese were all high quality ingredients.  The crust was just average.   I wasn't looking for an all natural, organic, locally grown, etc. establishment when I went to Pizza Fusion.  I am much more interested in good tasting food than I am with an all natural restaurant.  That being said, I actually went to this place out of shear convenience and it ended up being pretty good.

"I love shopping at Ross Stores. I stop at every one I come across. Yes, much of the merchandise is the same, but once in a while, you find a gem. It really is a treasure hunt. They carry a selection of ""as seen on Tv"" stuff, a slew of Jr's clothing, a decent selection of ladies and missy, but they generally fail at plus, men's and petite.  These markets are woefully represented. Sure they have a men's section, but looking through the stuff, it's crappy t shirts and fubu jeans. Hardly anything the men in my life would wear.This particular store's selection of lingerie/under garments is sad. They don't have a good variety of lingerie other than bras and panties.  Their home goods is very nicely situated as are their bed and bath items ... and their shoes!! My goodnes, their shoes are to die for!One rhing I've noticed recently is that they are carrying many more high end designers: Michael Kors, Calvin Klein, and others at decent prices.

"This is an out of the way location, between the university and the train tracks. We arrived at 5:30 to an almost empty restaurant but a packed bar. The bar only holds about twenty people and the restaurant about thirty and they are both in the same small room. The entire tiny kitchen is visible from the dining room. Since there were no seats at the bar, we asked for a table and the hostess was very reluctant to seat us at a table since we said we wanted to start with a drink before dinner. She wouldn't even promise to have a table for us if we started at at the bar. We had to insist on taking a table. It was awkward. The waitress was very pushy and kept coming over and picking up the menus and slapping them down on the table pressing us to hurry up and order our ""libations"". She seemed to think that the beer selection was awesome but it was actually mediocre. The whiskey selection was large, but only North American whiskeys, nothing Irish or Scotch. We ordered nine dishes. The shrimp and grits were good, but not outstanding and the portion is small, especially since they are supposed to be shared. The waitress said they didn't like the word ""tapas"" but that is exactly what they are. The pork belly was excellent and a good size and the collard greens were well prepared. The mac and cheese was mediocre and the catfish was awful. The ""mississippi mud pie"" wasn't even a pie, but a 6 ounce mason jar half filled with chocolate pudding. None of us would go back when so many better options are available. It seems that the top chef status of the person who conceptualized this place is enough to get its undeserved publicity.",tensor(0),"tensor([0], device='cuda:0')"
"Talk about a little slice of SERENITY IN THE CITY!!!! I saw this place prior to construction; to say it's been a major overhaul and all for the better is putting it mildly. Former warehouse area, this transformation is a god-send.  A hidden gem, as you have to mount the 96 plus stairs, I counted, from the street to the park. Great hidden gem. This park came from the ashes of the Phoenix. Former wharfs used to sit here, now the area has been transformed into an oasis of serenity. Climb the 96 or so stairs, I counted, to gain access to a little piece of earthly heaven in the form of breathtaking views of the city. Seems to be something straight from a postcard.

It's always inspiring to see people my age and older working out and taking care of themselves. Pleasant young man greets you at front desk.

There is background music that is set at a low volume so you can clearly hear your friends or not have to shout for them to hear you - perfect for the old library-esque environment. Working behind the bar were Michael and Peggy - both couldn't have been more friendly and were overall just interesting people to talk to.

I've had the Cuban sandwich, pretzels, bratwurst, and something else and considered licking the wax paper to get the last morsels. Sweet little patio overlooking the street and indoors seating too.

"My temporary apartment in Boise does not have a washer or dryer, so turned to Yelp to find one with good service and reasonable prices. A few popped up in the search and I decided to try my luck at Scrubby's. It has a fun name, after all.My first visit was on a Wednesday night after work. Parking lot was small but there were a few spaces available. When I first entered there were several people milling about, though none approached me so I wasn't sure if any were employees. The layout was as such: dryers lined the back and left side walls, rows of washers took up the center. Folding tables were scattered between the washers and laundry carts were interspersed throughout. The walls (both interior and exterior) were decorated in whimsical paintings and neon lights in shapes of bubbles and clotheslines, which was a cute touch.I walked to the second row and tried to find an open washer. There were plenty, but what I quickly realized was that nearly all of the $1.25 washers were ""out of order,"" while the $1.75 were all working. Convenient. I loaded up two machines. They were good sizes and easily fit all of my items. Washes took just under 30 mins, so ran over to Albertson's across the street to grab a sandwich for dinner. Once I was back, I loaded my stuff in two dryers. Cost is $0.25/7 minutes for regular size, $0.25/4 minutes for XL dryers. You have options of high, permanent press, and low heat. The regulars worked well; one dryer needed 3 cycles, the other 4. I used permanent press.Overall a decent laundromat. They have wifi which was a nice way to kill some time waiting. It was relatively clean and odor free, though the constant barrage of flies can be really annoying. And while I wasn't approached by anyone, a girl did eventually make her way to another customer who needed help. Note: they have coin machines to make change but no ATM. Go to Albertson's for that, or come prepared with cash. Scrubby's also has a drop-and-go service that might be worth pursuing if that's your thing. And they have a loyalty card that gives you $1.50 in cash after 6 visits. Be sure to ask for one. I would use this place again, and in fact did so on a Friday afternoon with a similar experience, though with the addition of Maury paternity tests on TV. On that visit I noticed they had repaired a few of the $1.25 machines, which is the reason I bumped my original 3 star review to 4.

Currently by the time of this review, they now have a whole bunch of really nice fall Decour to choose from and I ended up buying the place, LOL. The Dollarspot in this area is always that every entry of a Target. The prices either one $1 or $3.The remainder of the store is broken up into multiple departments which include the electronics, women's, menus, boys and girls (children), who Decore (which is even broken down further), pharmacy, health and beauty, Etc. The stores are usually very organized and clean, but not as packed as other superstores as far as crowd goes. I always enjoy coming in here every now and then either for gifts, groceries, or odds and ends, etc. The home Decore is usually unique brands to target stores. The grocery portion of the store contains the same products as any other grocery store consisting of major brands and also generic brands from target themselves.They have staff everywhere walking around with microphones ready to help you. They have call stations spread out evenly throughout the store so if you need help in a department, you just pick up the phone and call via phone prompts and someone will be right there with you in the next minute or less. I just love the crisp red and white environment in here (I'm pretty partial to the red color) they definitely pay attention to the ergonomics and environmental style of the place.

We never knew it was so close!Be sure to look on their website for tour times before going and read the FAQ's. - First note: There were many people wearing flip flops on our tours vs. the insisted closed toe shoe policy, but that could be because of the next note.- Second note: There is no production/brewing on Saturdays so the brewery is quiet and empty.We looked around the main waiting/lobby area and gift shop waiting for our 12p tour to begin.  We had quite a large group, which had to split into two smaller ones. The tour lasted about 40 minutes, starting with a ten minute video of the history of Yuengling and the rise to present day. Next, the guide takes you out to the brewery, and into the kettle room, around through the lab, the bottle line, and the holding tanks. The tour was informative and hands on. Our guide was informative and knew quite a lot about the history and brewing process. She did a great job!Once done, you loop back into the lobby where the tasting room is and it's drinks galore.

The wait time was standard- I don't recall it arriving early nor do I recall being antsy about its whereabouts. I'm no stranger to the Imam Baldi. I think every time I have this eggplant in red sauce soufflé, I go on the record that this dish can turn me into a vegetarian. It came with the standard sides of rice, veggies and potatoes, all separated by little dividers as to not mingle. We were first timers to the Skordalia. Think extra, extra whipped mashed potatoes with extra, extra garlic. Move over (already fabulous hummus), you may have just been replaced in our repertoire. Okay, I kid. We'll just get both and have leftovers.Speaking of leftovers, we totally were able to split our order into two meals. Score!  Love that fresh bread they put on the table?

Doing the tourist thing at Valley Forge and Philadelphia we came upon this restaurant by chance.  Our entrees were great and the Indian bread sampler was delicious.  We had enough left over for breakfast the next morning and had leftover bread for lunch that day.  We were so impressed we made a special trip back out to King of Prussia to eat again that night.  The owner of the restaurant was extremely nice and took a genuine interest in his customers.,tensor(1),"tensor([1], device='cuda:0')"

"As soon as I walked in, I knew I did the right thing in getting the Yelp deal. I ordered some Pho, Summer rolls, and the Basil Chicken. It's been a long time since I've had Pho and while the broth and accompaniments were on point, I remembered why it had been so long since having it. Too much involved with the noodles and the broth and then of course I over did it with the sriracha! But still -- very flavorful. I should have gone with the Pho with chicken instead of the Pho with Eye-Round steak, Flank, Fat Brisket, Tendon & Tripe. The Basil chicken was beyond amazing. I have to admit, I did not think I'd eat the whole portion, but I did. It was 2pm and I hadn't eaten all day so needless to say, I was starving!! The amount of veggies in this dish was great. Eggplant, snow pea pods, green, red, yellow and orange peppers, mushrooms, string beans! But that special spicy sauce. OMG I could eat that like it was soup. Delish! I keep on forgetting what the summer roll is and each time I order it, I wanna smack myself for not remembering. I don't really like the wrapper. Pardon me for being vulgar, but it reminds me of a condom. I meant to order the rolls that are fried! Oh well, next time I'll get it right. Overall, for my first time ordering here, I was pleased.  I'd definitely recommend the Yelp Deal. I wish I was able to find a menu online, otherwise I would have ordered ahead of time!",tensor(1),"tensor([1], device='cuda:0')"

I got a side order of the battered green beans. They were suppose to be spicy, but I was told they didn't make them spicy that particular day. Well, okay then. I ordered them anyways and I was so glad that I wasn't deterred by the fact that they weren't spicy because they were the most lightly battered, perfectly crunchy, and delicious green beans I have ever tasted.

So I'm not sure what the big deal is over this place. Your Clarksville Tn location has nothing but positive reviews. We were looking forward to having a nice family dinner at your Springfield location tonight. However that sadly did not happen my husband found his food bland and lacking seasoning of any kind he ordered just a simple cheeseburger. And I ordered your salmon with a Baked potato and garden salad. My Salmon was RAW in the middle and I don't mean just slightly pink there was a good half a inch to a inch worth of RAW salmon I sent it back to be recooked. Well when it came back out it was clear my dinner had been place in most likely a Microwave  the ends that I had pulled apart for my 8 year old to eat prior to realizing the fish was RAW  were now so dry and curled over. When I asked the manager who brought me my food back if they microwaved my fish I was told NO. Problem here my fish came back to me the exact way I sent it to be recooked nothing on the plate was out of place.

We dragged our hungover asses out of bed and walked in here with hopes of eating some delicious food and a well needed dose of caffeine. We each got started with coffee, which was absolutely fantastic. I ordered the southern breakfast and requested toast instead of sausage, while my friends ordered the soft shell crab and crab omelet. I loved the food I ordered.. except everything lacked a little seasoning. Also, the bacon was completely dry. I love bacon in any shape or form, so I didn't seem to mind the lack of grease. The jalapeno grits were spectacular and so was the biscuit. My friends seemed to really enjoy their breakfast as well. The fries again, lacked seasoning which seemed odd.

I'm also a big fan of their tea. It comes in a cute little Cake Bake teapot and they have a really great selection. Now for the desserts: I've had several and you cannot go wrong!!!

"More Than Just Ice Cream....I walked in the door hungry as all hell, ready to rock out. I started off with an order of hummus...which never came.  My lady friend ordered a bowl of the turkey chili...and I am glad she went with a bowl versus a cup, because, well...the hummus never came. The turkey chili was quite delicious, and I give it a good recommendation. I elected to go with one of the day's specials...walnut-encrusted chicken with haricot verts and mashed root vegetables. What does that mean exactly? Parsnips instead of potatoes? Parsnips AND potatoes? I am pretty sure there was no yucca involved. LOL I digress. The mashed root veggies was the star of the plate though. The string beans tasted of charred water. The walnut-encrusted chicken was a tasty idea, but the crusting was quite overcooked, again lending a burnt flavor. The chicken came covered in a maple gravy...mild taste of maple, and it was a cream gravy. I was expecting a brown gravy with the maple flavor.The waiter did not bring me a knife and fork, which was his second strike after the missed hummus. I was so hungry I did not care, however. I cleaned my plate thoroughly. On to the ice cream!!! My lady friend and I split a belgian waffle, topped with ice cream. As the man, the choice was left to me to pick the ice cream flavor. I went with cinnamon bun, and it was GREAT. The waffle was hot and freshly cooked perfectly, slightly underdone and soft which favored the ice cream on top. The creamy cinnamon flavor was very decadent, especially because it included multiple globules of cinnamon-sugarized butter.  Wowzers.

We ordered our food and she just kinda dropped everything off on one end of the table and then left.  The only waitress/bartender who ever came by to ask if we were okay was Lindsay.  It seemed like they thought they were too good to offer good service. Oh, yea, and Zoey was rude enough that I complained to the manager of the hotel.  I would never come back here and I would def tell my friends not to either.  Oh, and don't try to use your Straz tickets for the free appetizer like they advertise if you want your ticket back.

I reckon it's not so easy to find an unhaunted hotel in these parts, the city that is called--among other things--the most haunted city in America.  New Orleans also has some of the best food, music, art and people anywhere. But back to the hotel, there is a certain just-past-its-prime grandeur to the decor. I liked it. My room was spacious, clean and quiet; it overlooked the lovely pool area, and had a comfy King size bed. The staff was friendly and quick. While the French Quarter was not particularly damaged by the hurricane, many New Orleans neighborhoods were--and are far from full recovery post-Katrina.

"Came down from Jersey after seeing the Dan Band perform, which was phenomenal! We got the urge to order a hookah with a liquor option. Walked over to Fez.. no one attended us at first so we sat down at the couch area. The place was dead for 10pm Friday. The attendant came and said let me seat you someplace else. I asked to keep the seat I was already at. He said we couldn't, so I told him to speak to whomever to get the approval. The guy came out and ask what's the problem. I said hey boss, your place is dead and we'd like to sit at the large couch area. He said they can't because that's for parties of 8. I said I understand, but there was no one in your store and if that big party ever came, we would move. Their answer: no we can't. I said no problem, packed my things and was ready to walk out. The guy asked are you really leaving? I said bro, no one is here. The place is dead. What do I have to do? Order a bottle? He said no again.. so.. went to a better spot! Saqqara Hookah bear broad across from City Diner! So much better staff! No young deutche bags trying to show how much more testosterone they have.Saqqara had great fast hookah service, really really great food and best part, was their service.

We politely informed her that we did not receive menus and would need time to order. She indicated she would return in a moment to place our order. After another 10 minutes she returns and took our order. My salad was right however we were not provided utensils, which I had to go fetch myself. My husband also inquired if a specific game could be showed on the tv. Our waitress stated she would check and returns to tell my husband he would need to ask all 8 folks sitting at the bar if it would be okay to change one of the tvs that's showing the same things as 2 other tvs. The final thing that has disappointed me and caused me to waste my time to make this complaint is that 2 men who arrived nearly 5 minutes after us placing our order were provided their food (nachos) before us who also had ordered one nacho.

The fitness floor is huge, and I never had to wait for a treadmill or other piece of equipment. (I usually was there around 6am, a peak time.) Gym is kept very clean as is the locker room. There is also a beautiful lap pool, although I only used it a couple of times so I can't comment on the wait time for lanes. Also, excellent classes particularly Shoshanna's weight training in the AM as well as spin classes.

But out waiter had informed us that they ran out of the specific crab we wanted, but gave us two different crabs that was equivalent to the weight of the crab that we missed out on.Once our food arrived, we dug right in. Everything tasted, so delicious and fresh. We finished off everything that we ordered and made sure not to leave any sort of crab meat morsel behind. The shrimp salad was surprisingly good.

"Myron and perma ceram were recommended to me by a contractor/friend.  My tub had some rust and chipping which was explained to Myron when we were scheduling the job.  The price seemed reasonable, so I said okay.  Mike came out a few days later and was a nice guy.  He took a look at the tub and said the repairs would be no problem.  He said he can fix the rust and the tub would look like new. After he was finished and he was paid I was handed a receipt/invoice. Once Mike leaves,  I read what he handed me and at the end it states there is no warranty for rust.  What!  Why wouldn't you say that to me.  I just would have bought a new tub for the price.  Once the tub dried, I could get a closer look and there were several areas it appeared weren't sanded down so there were ridges along several edges.  Not a new tub, so I could live with that.Fast forward, a couple months went bye and what do you know, I could see the rust coming through. So I call Myron to schedule an appointment and after months of run around, I get a call asking if they can come Christmas Eve. Seriously!

"What's up with your night? Well, why not grab a classic Tony Luke's Jersey-style cheesesteak and hit up the bar connected to the bowling alley. Bowling alley? Cheesesteak chain with a dive bar? Okay, I am cringing on the thought of how embarrassing that sounds for NJ, but regardless that's how the good old Garden State represents. I met up with my group of guys and gals, surrounded ourselves with our glorious looking cheesesteaks, filled up on drinks and sat around b/sing the night away at the bar. Aw, yeah! A laid back night with food and my buds.At Tony's you can order cheesesteak (substitution chicken steak available), burgers, fries and your standard fried grab and go grub. My cheesesteak was served on a fresh roll, with American cheese that complimented the steak with fried mushrooms. With a handful of fries, it was all washed down with a cold one from the inside bar. Now, it wasn't by far the best cheesesteak I've had but right square dead in the middle of good and average.Despite the sticky floor and fact that my shoes felt suctioned to the ground, service was decent. The cashier takes the order, lists your name and when they're ready it's announced on the loud speaker. The loud speaker shout out is clutch because there is no need to stand around awkwardly waiting. You are free to roam around and come or go.

"My problem isn't with the Chesterbrook Trader Joe's per se, it is with their ""home office"". They drop items faster than you would drop a hot knife. Over the years, I've loved their Curried Tuna, in pouches, about a buck sixty-nine, in red, yellow and green curries. Add some rice, a splash of coconut milk and fresh cilantro leaves and you have a marvelous casserole. I bought it, the rice and the coconut milk by the bagfuls. How did Trader Joe's reward my fidelity? THEY DISCONTINUED IT...saying it wasn't ""cost-effective"" to the consumer. WHA??Over the years, I bought their Greek-style spinach pie with feta cheese. It was a very popular item. Then, one day, they replaced that item with a Trader Joe's pie...spinach and kale with feta. That new pie tasted like grass that had just been cut by a mower. Yuuuck. Their explanation? They wanted a Trader Joe's product so they discontinued the one that was better but wasn't made by Trader Joe's.The list goes, sadly, on and on. Buy a product at Trader Joe's, like the product, buy even more of the product and, yet...""home office"" drops that item for no apparent reason...time after time after time.I have to admit: I go to Traders a lot less these days because you can never depend on a product you've supported and bought in abundance actually being there. The people at the customer service desk see me coming and hide because they have run out of explanations as to why seemingly popular items are dropped.So, Trader Joe's...you're running customers off because of the abrupt changes with the availability of products in your stores.

"$5 mimosas to follow a new years eve hangover? You had me at hello. Pub and Kitchen is a very relaxed and easygoing hangout spot with good food to match. The bf and I were both craving some red meat so we decided to try P&K. We were seated in the back little private dining room which is cozy with lots of small tables, exposed brick, and natural light. The burger was cooked to my liking and they were very accommodating to some topping substitutions. I loved the fries and the food, the waiter was extremely cool. The only downside - and it had nothing to do with P&K - was the fact that because of the mummers parade there seemed to be tons of loud families in what would usually not be a typical family establishment.

"I've been to Hot Diggity twice: once the week it opened, and today, to bring my friends.  I like hot dogs, but I'm a vegetarian; which is why I'm a fan of this place - they have 2 dog options: meat and non-meat.  Then you get to choose from 10 different regional styles of condiment ""packages"" to add to your dog.  The first time, I had the Fiesta (guacamole, lettuce, tomato, topped with sour cream) - yummm.  Today, I had the Windy City (pickle, relish, onions, and mustard) - again yummm.  I've always been a fan of the Chicago-style dog, however, so this was no surprise.  They also sell hand-cut fries (which I find are a tad bit overly salted) that you can purchase additional dips for, like Peppercorn Ranch, Rosemary Aioli, or Chimichurri Sauce.  The ranch was decent, but the rosemary aioli was a bit bland, and the chimichurri sauce was not true chimichurri sauce, but more like a chimichurri sauce + salt and mayo - lime.  I am not mad about the dips, though - after all, they were only 25 cents each, and I like trying things.  I just won't buy the same ones anymore.I like this place to come back again and again to keep trying all the different varieties.

This office was wonderful and not only did I get an appointment very quickly, the front office staff was very polite and personable - as we all know, this is not always the case. I am a dental office wimp and they provided caring service and the procedure was relatively painless (same as other offices I had been to).  I did not feel like anyone was trying to sell me anything which was a nice surprise.  The dentist was wonderful; explained the procedure step by step and made me feel at east and NOT like a number.  The billing went through seamlessly which was a bonus as my regular office there are always billing issues.  I was  pleasantly surprised by my experience at this office as I found them through an internet search.  Thank you Center City Emergency Dentist!!!

"Let me first say that I went here on a Saturday which I would never do so needless to say I had to wait but not very long.

I really needed my nails done so I went with it. I actually like it! The guy who did my nails, Le, did a great job and got my nails just right!

"This place is hip.  Perhaps too hip for many over 35 but if you can tolerate the boisterous and extremely casually attired youth--I haven't worn a suit in 20 years either but even 20 year olds should have something besides skinny jeans and T-shirts with borderline obscene slogans in their closets--the food is worth it and the staff copes well.   I had a 6:00 reservation (obtained the day before) but the sky seemed threatening a downpour so I came early to avoid it and was seated 20 minutes or so before the appointed time.  I often don't even make reservations and have no trouble getting seated at popular places by being there when they open or, for those open all day, coming before the popular dinner hour, but that didn't work the day before at Lüke.  Even at 4:30 the place was packed so I did make one for the following day.My meal started with the crispy Brussel Sprouts.  Even if you hate Brussels sprouts (I like them), don't be afraid to try this dish--if no one told you you might not know what you were eating.  They are in some sort of sweet/sour sauce/dressing and fried both slightly blackened and crispy as advertised . . . tossed with almond slices, small bits of jalapeño and sprinkled with shavings of cheese on top.Then I had pork schnitzel and ""pommes frites"" (that's shoestring fries to the Galliphobes).  It came with whitish gravy in a pitcher, I suppose to make it ""Southern"".  The gravy was good but I skipped eating it, doing that the usual way with a squeeze of lemon.  It was excellent and the fries were fine too.I finished with some excellent decaf and a glass of Kahlua--I had had iced tea with the meal so some alcohol was not an excess.A lady who was some sort of hostess dropped by my table while I was eating to make sure everything was OK and when told I needed ketchup (for the fries), went and got me some (in a dainty little single-serve Heinz bottle).  My waiter also checked several times but didn't hover.I am giving it 4 stars.  The 5th star is withheld because of the crowded dining room and noise level . . . nothing to do with the food which I greatly enjoyed.",tensor(1),"tensor([0], device='cuda:0')"

"Well, Chatham Tap is about as inoffensive as a bar can be. It doesn't overwhelm you with the TeeVees like a lot of sports bars (there's just one giant screen behind the bar). The atmosphere is cozy but there's still decent seating, the staff is friendly and the menu is even a little out there for pub food--gouda melted over apples on ciabatta? Hmm.... I had an apple, candied walnut and feta salad. Don't be fooled by the fact that it's called ""salad""--it was more like dessert. They could lay off the candied walnuts and raspberry dressing a bit and this would be a lot better and healthier option. I tried my companion's pesto and mushroom sandwich and it was quite good (probably not healthy either). The thick spicy chips were yummy (possibly homemade?). I guess most people don't go to bars to get healthful food, but I sometimes like to mitigate the beer calories by choosing the less fatty-sounding pub fare. I think Old Point may be a better option for those situations.And, regarding beer.... I drank London Pride, which was decent. I'm not really wowed by places that have Boddington's and Fat Tire on tap--these are mass-produced and -distributed beer, people! That said, it's better than Bud or Coors. Overall, Chatham is a decent bar. I can see why some might be more smitten than I was--it manages to offer a bit more than your generic pub experience and that can go a long way in Indy. If you're a football (soccer) fan you might also give this place extra points. But for me there wasn't really anything special to grab on to.",tensor(0),"tensor([0], device='cuda:0')"

"Then Comes Baby is an incredible resource and was life-saving for lactation consultation. We first encountered TCB/Sabrina for a lactation class. Before even signing up for the prenatal class, I spoke with Sabrina on the phone. She was incredibly helpful, getting me resources for doulas and advice about how to obtain support through the whole birth process. We signed up for the prenatal series but were only able to make it to the breastfeeding class b/c our son came early. The class was great and I can only assume that the rest of the prenatal class would have been just as good. Sabrina helped put me in touch with an inpatient nurse at UCSF where we were going to deliver to discuss the possibility for pre-expressed breast milk if my baby was to need supplementation, etc. She went out of her way to get us the help that we needed. But, then the real magic started with her assistance. I ended up having severe preeclampsia and delivering my baby a month early. We were having trouble with breastfeeding in the hospital and I sent Sabrina an email which she replied to and offered her assistance, along with advice and help obtaining a hospital grade pump. She then came over to our home the day after we were home from the hospital. From that day forward, she was available weekly at my house and by email and phone. We had a particularly difficult time with breastfeeding. My baby boy was  a month early, had totricollis, and was tongue tied. Sabrina walked us through all of this and helped us at every step of the way, from softly suggesting a dentist to release his tongue and lip tie, to urging us to get cranio-sacral work on a weekly basis, to lending us a scale to weigh our boy. For two months, he would not breast feed and then he learned to latch! Sabrina was still by my side teaching me how to transition from my comfort zone of measuring out all of his ounces to trusting that he was getting enough directly from my breast. My baby boy never went hungry the whole time he was learning and never needed supplementation beyond my breastmilk. Some of the most important things that are special about Sabrina is that she supported what I wanted, but she was also clear about getting nutition to my baby. Lots of moms who have trouble with breastfeeding and who desire to exclusively breast feed, run into the problem of under-feeding their baby, which causes problems in the long run that are much worse than supplementing with formula. Sabrina watched the growth of our baby boy closely to make sure that he was always getting enough and made sure that my supply was developed well so that I always produced enough. The second thing that is special about Sabrina is that she is a LC who supports whatever mom's want. She alters her plans according to family wishes. She also was very cognizant of my emotional state and making sure that I was taking care of myself. This is really important because it is difficult to want to breastfeed and to have to pump and bottle feed while trying to teach your baby to latch. It takes about 20 hours/day and is painful work when he/she is not able to latch. Sabrina kept checking in with me to make sure that I was still emotionally holding up. In the end, it worked out for me. He is now exclusively breastfed and we were even able to travel to Maui for 5 days where he breastfed on the beach and at waterfalls. It was glorious and everything I ever hoped for in a breastfeeding relationship with my son. I am now transitioning to work and Sabrina has been there as a support through phone consultation. As a physician, I think it is incredibly important to have this kind of support. I only wish that our health insurance--public and private--supported this kind of consultation because for some cases, like mine, it was absolutely necessary, and Sabrina and TCB were there every step of the way. I cannot more highly recommend them.",tensor(1),"tensor([1], device='cuda:0')"

"Stay away. My husband and I stopped here this afternoon to use a gift card given to us a long time ago. We do not normally buy cold stone ice cream, and we're pretty easy to please. All we were looking for was a nice cold treat on a hot day- what we got was a small ice cream that was way too sweet (yes, even for ice cream!), and a chocolate shake that was not good, for about $11. My husband took one sip of his shake and pushed it away. I took a taste and agreed that something was not right. It had a distinctly sour, bitter aftertaste. While I finished my ice cream, he debated about whether he wanted something else instead. Since the ingredients seemed to be the problem, he decided did not want something else, even though my ice cream seemed fine. When I took the shake back to the register and explained the problem, we were told we could not receive a refund, only a replacement. Both of us had an upset stomach for about two hours afterwards, and neither of us had more than a sip or two. Poor customer service, bad ingredients. Food poisoning is not worth $11, so we simply left.Poor customer service is my biggest pet peeve- as someone who has worked in customer service and international sales for four years, I promise you- it's really not THAT difficult of a task to make sure your customer is happy, even if there is a language/geographical barrier (today, there was neither). While I realize that the employee I spoke to is probably a minimum wage high school student, store policies that young woman has to follow are set by real adults. Whoever set the policies for this store clearly is not doing their job!Shame on you, coldstone, for trying to give my (active-duty & a veteran) husband food poisoning on Memorial Day, and refusing to make any real attempt to make amends.

The crepe itself was soft with a warm buttery flavor and had a slight crispiness to the outside. Just incredible. The inside was well seasoned (savory) and had just the right balance of ingerdients.After taking the first bite, it was so good that I didn't know if I could stop myself from stuffing it into my mouth as fast a possible, but I knew that I should slow down to savor every morsel.The service was perfection and the only drawback was the slightly high prices.

"Sorry Yelpers, but I thought this Jose Garces restaurant was just okay.Village Whiskey is pretty tiny.  About seven round tables that could fit maybe three people (might be able to fit four, but highly unlikely) and some room at the bar.  Came for lunch at 11:30am when they opened, and by about 12:15pm, all the tables and most of the seats at the bar were taken.  We were the second group to be seated, and although there was no one else in the restaurant at the time, our waitress seemed to be preoccupied after taking our order.  She knew we were still deciding on drinks, so why didn't she check on us again?  Hello!  She wasn't very attentive and seemed like she would rather be elsewhere.I ordered the Village Burger (an 8 ounce burger on a sesame roll with Boston bibb lettuce, tomato, and house-made thousand island dressing: $11) and added Jasper Hill cheddar cheese ($3.50) and fried egg ($1.50).  Perfect brunch meal right?  Eh.  Was just okay.  The burger wasn't anything spectacular, definitely not anything to rave about.  It was juicy, but lacked flavor.  Usually the bun makes the burger (for me at least), and I thought the sesame roll was okay.  Tasted like an everyday burger bun to me.  The cheddar cheese and fried egg were a nice additional to the burger.  At 8 ounces, this burger is pretty huge!  Could definitely serve as another meal or late night snack.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/EtKSTHV5Qx_Q7Aur9o4kQQ?select=QZ4Yn47TLprQlbCRWMtZdwWe also ordered the duck fat french fries with sly-fox cheddar sauce ($7) to share.  I've always always wanted to try duck fat fries.  These left me wanting more.  Really...is this what they really taste like?  I hope not.  These fries were more soggy than crispy, and left a weird after taste in my mouth.  The cheddar sauce was a welcomed additional, but not necessary.  The sauce would have been better if it was hotter.  When our waitress finally came back with our food, we were able to order the Irish Car Bomb shake ($9).  Ours definitely didn't look like a lot of the pictures that were posted on Yelp.  For $9, this shake better be spectacular!  Again, it was just okay.  I did enjoy those chunks of brownie pieces though! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/EtKSTHV5Qx_Q7Aur9o4kQQ?select=EbqJLiD6Pkw7u1KgFVmJAARG ordered the Whiskey King (an 8 ounce burger on a sesame roll with maple bourbon glazed ciopollini, rogue bleu cheese, applewood bacon, and foie gras-$26).  Massive burger.  The bleu cheese was almost non-existent.  I tried a bite, and the foie gras was pretty good.  The applewood bacon was a nice touch.  But again, the burger was just okay.

I have yet to try Bolton's but I plan to very soon. The guys at Hot Stuff also have hot ribs which seems really interesting, and I'll review again when I get around to trying it. They also have hot chicken salad, so if you're into plants and all that, there it is.  The menu is a lil diverse, so unlike the original hot chicken joints, this place has fish and ribs too.All in all, it's good when you're on the south side and want some hot chicken.

"It's a Walgreens. It's a chain. It's in my hood. Being in my hood, is reason enough to bump them up a star. Actually, the extra star is my Christmas gift to them. Because, their great sales made my budget for ""Secret Santa"" at work go further. I wasn't even looking here and found a perfect gift as I entered and it was 50% off. More gifts, the merrier the recipient. I am also a fan of their photo lab. It is so easy to submit pictures via the Walgreens app. Once my photos are ready to pick-up, they'll text me. Then all I have to do is jump in the car and drive up Hampton a couple of blocks. It usually takes less then two hours and the quality is good. I don't use the pharmacy, but this is my go-to for over the counter drugs. The prices are good and I've never seen them out of stock for any of the products I use.

"We recently checked out GM Bistro off La Canada and Lambert, and it was cramped, noisy and the food was average, only so-so.  What a pleasant surprise to find Chopstix and have a really superior experience!  I'm very strictly gluten-free, and they have a real gluten-free menu with about 6 pages, not just a handful of choices.  My husband ordered the orange chicken, the same meal as he had at GM for a true comparison, and raved about how much better it was at Chopstix. I had a lettuce wrap appetizer - almost $2 off during happy hour - consisting of a large mound of various chopped items and about half a head of iceberg lettuce that was basically a full meal in itself, and was incredibly tasty!  I loved it so much I ordered a second one, had about 4-5 more wraps out of it, then had to have them box up the rest.  I hated to have to stop eating, it was so good but I was so full!  I have a medical situation where I have to eat quite a large quantity of food for dinner, and I can't remember ever having an appetizer that was big enough for an entire meal for me - and most of the time, it's rare that I can even eat any appetizers anywhere because of the gluten in them.So the service was excellent, the food was **outstanding**, and I had a lovely conversation with the manager, whose last day it was.  He has worked with the Southern Arizona Celiac Association, so the employees at Chopstix are extremely well-educated re gluten issues there, which is great because I got glutened just a few doors down from them last week at Native New Yorker, due to poor education on gluten cross-contamination (they served me wings that had been fried in the same oil as stuff with breading.)If I could give more than 5 stars, I would.

I enjoyed several red wines, a cava, and a few glasses of beer over several recent visits.  They also offer a limited menu of smaller plates, charcuterie and the likes, from which I have not ordered.  Given their offerings, I'm sure these are quite nice.

"Five words: Peanut Butter Chocolate Milk Stout. Dear gawd I love this stuff! Keep in mind I was skeptical. I usually stick with Single Speed, which is on the complete opposite end of the spectrum, but when literally every other person you are with is drinking this ""Reeses cup beer"" you eventually take a sip, and discover that it is delicious and you kick Single Speed to the curb and end up roaming around Randall's like a crazy person until the nice girl stocking beer notices you and carries over a bottle asking ""is this what you're looking for?"" and you want to hug her. But I digress....  If you can't track down the peanut butter, their regular chocolate milk stout runs a close second in my book, and this is coming from someone who is not a big fan of dark beers. Maybe my taste buds are changing with old age, who knows. I have my fingers crossed that they won't take it away as the weather warms up!The tasting room is probably one of my current favorite spaces. It's all concrete and metal a distressed wood and an awesome wall of custom ""wallpaper"" (it's a stencil). It's gets crazy crowded in here on weekends, but the bartenders are efficient and it never takes long to get a refill. They also have limited seating outside on the sidewalk, which is awesome on warm days, and they generally have an amazing soundtrack going. If drinking round after round of beer gives you the drunk munchies (no? just me?) you can grab a snack from Fifth Wheel, which is basically a tiny Bailey's kitchen that offers up nachos, pretzels and other pub fare to go along with your beer.

The cafe itself is pretty big and has 2 areas that are separated by the counter/kitchen. They also have a bar (hence the name) and a food menu. Their desserts are generously proportioned and there's a wide selection to choose from. My friend and I tried the oversized snickerdoodle cookie, which was pretty decent for a standard cookie- soft and chewy and not overly sweet. The staff was very friendly and flexible. Definitely a place I'll have to come back to.",tensor(1),"tensor([1], device='cuda:0')"
"Pros: I was able to make a sameday appointment for both my sister and myself. The woman running the front desk was very welcoming and was expecting us. I had told her on the phone that I wanted a strong deep tissue massage and she hooked me up with a really fabulous young woman. It was one of the best massages I've ever had. I really liked that she asked me what I wanted. She tailored the massage to my needs (neck and shoulders) rather than going through the motions and doing my whole body. My sister and I had massages in the same room at the same time, and it was nice that we could do that. Cons (I'm extremely picky and mostly pointing this out to help Massage Envy, not to dissuade): I did not love how the receptionists are at the front desk loudly making confirmation calls while you're sitting waiting for the massage therapist. But My sister wasn't as thrilled by her massage person. There were only enough hooks for one person's stuff in our double room.Our therapists chatted amongst themselves a bit more than we would have preferred. Overall, highly recommended! I am a member, so I can get my massages at the local member price, which in Tampa is pretty low. It's a bargain for a lovely service!",tensor(1),"tensor([0], device='cuda:0')"

When I went to the front desk the next morning to complete the upgrade, I was told it would be $80.  There was no explanation as to why I was quoted two totally different amounts.But the room was decent.  Definitely clean.  The decor left a lot to be desired unless you like cheap victorian/renaissance/old-school type stuff.  I can't believe they paid someone for the fake hideous artwork in the place.Our room had an awesome view of the trash area, and we had to go up a floor, walk down the skywalk, then down a floor and back to our room.

After several return trips ( dressed appropriately!) I can tell you that all their servers I have had are very knowledgeable about the menu and the wine list, and the food is ridiculously good.

"OK sooooooooooooooooo I'm not a chicken eater; as a result this review will be about the service on the 1st day of opening:Signs provided a countdown to the opening, I found this to be a plus, no need to stalk the building, you know. AnyWHO, on opening day, in the drive thru, I found the cashiers to be efficient, friendly (speaking to my 11month old niece), timely &  swift in their transactions. I placed two separate food orders, one for my granny & my sister. Pricing was fair, you can get a whole meal &  drink for less than $7; one of those 3 chicken fingers deals; that's cool, I've become so accustomed to $10+ for fast food meals until I was pleasantly surprised at this event. The lemonade is very tasty &  since I only got a sip of my sister's, I vowed to return for my own. As stated, the drive thru line moved rather swiftly considering this was the 1st day; I was impressed. Only thing I would've liked to see was the store set a little more off the street because the drive thru line hung out into the street making passing as I exited a very difficult feat.

It had a nice earthy truffle taste, balanced with the saltiness of the Parmesan, and rounded out with the rosemary. Main course was the Bacon Wrapped shrimp with Stone ground Grits. This was exceptional - and was probably the best 'shrimp n' grits' i've had in NOLA. Shrimp was perfectly cooked, with a crisp piece of bacon wrapped around it.

"I stayed at the Hotel Monaco on a recent visit to Philadelphia and I was impressed with almost everything. Everywhere I went in the hotel itself, staff were happy, friendly, and welcoming. This wasn't the case only with me and it did not come across as fake or forced. I am a people watcher, so I observed the staff interacting with several guests and they were consistently good service providers. The Red Owl Tavern has great food, and generally great service, but while I was there for brunch, there was one server behind the ready-to-eat bar in the Tavern that was in a bad mood, unfriendly, aloof, or some combination of all three. She did not acknowledge people when they ordered-she would just turn around and start getting what they asked for. She also got into it with another server who apparently experienced the same rude attitude I and my fellow patrons did. I cannot emphasize enough that almost every other person there had a great attitude and was more than friendly. One bad apple...ironic since she has red hair. I realize that the Tavern is likely under different management, but it does affect a hotel guest's experience, and in my case, it did so negatively. The only reason I can't give the hotel 5 stars, however, has nothing to do with the Tavern. It is because our room was not touched once we checked in. Not one time. It was immaculate upon arrival, but that was the last time I saw it that way. I shouldn't have to call the front desk for either a daily once-over or turn-down service. To be fair, I in fact did not call the front desk, because I was running around almost the whole time I was in Philadelphia, but that's exactly why I wanted to come back to a tidied room. This is an oversight I did not expect from such a great chain. The Monaco included all of the amazing features of a Kimpton hotel. My dog was warmly greeted everywhere we went in the hotel, her dog bed and bowls were already in the room, and the decor was, as always, remarkable, interesting, and quirky. The staff was unbelievably friendly and helpful, and the complimentary drinks in the morning and for happy hour don't hurt!Overall, probably one of the best places to stay in Philadelphia. It's a new hotel, so I'm sure the housekeeping issue will be addressed in time. Just growing pains.",tensor(1),"tensor([0], device='cuda:0')"

"Our group had intended to sit out in the patio, but since It was too hot, we decided to sit inside the restaurant.  First impression; it was noisy and the decor needed some upgrading.  Our waiter came to our table and immediately wanted us to order appetizers even though the rest of the group was still parking their cars (incidentally don't go on a Wednesday in the summer, the parking lot is full due to people going to the farmer's market).  The waiter also behaved unprofessionally and kept interrupting and then didn't show up. When I ask if there is a charge for a substitution on the side dish, he said it would only be $1 extra. After we placed our order, it took a long time (at least 1/2 hour or more) to get our food. The dishes were just typical bar food and not particularly warm when they finally arrived at our table.  There's a great selection of good, quality beer, though. When we got our check, I noticed that I was charged $4.50 for the substitution of the side order.  When I questioned the waiter in the front of our group, he said that's what they charge and made no attempt to contact his manager to change it. He merely said that ""you got an extra large order"".  I didn't want an extra large order so again I ask if he would change it and he just shrugged his shoulders and left.  A few days later, I phoned the manager to let him know about our experience. He appeared to be concerned about the treatment we received. I mentioned to him that it had been my turn to pick a venue for our group and frankly, no one in our group was particularly pleased with the service.  I told him that I was calling because I don't like to put bad reviews on yelp and hoped that he would give extra training to his employee. He apologized profusely and said he would send me a gift certificate. I told that that it wasn't necessary but that it would be appreciated.  He said that he'd send one anyway and I gave him my address. I never heard back from him - not even a note. That was three weeks ago so here's my review.",tensor(0),"tensor([0], device='cuda:0')"

"I really enjoyed the sweet potato fries with sriracha aioli - definitely the highlight of my visit.  Hip City Veg offers this sophisticated dish, which you might expect to see only at much fancier restaurants, in a casual, fast-food setting.  Based on prior Yelp reviews, I tried the udon noodle salad, which was pretty good, but was a little unbalanced and could be improved.  Although it had a promising start with a pleasant mix of ""chick'n"", arugula, and alfalfa sprouts, the bottom half of the salad had too much seasoning.  An easy fix might be to ease up on the dressing, or leave it as a side component.  The dining atmosphere is pleasant - sort of like an eco-friendly, fast food joint that seeks to bring vegan dishes to the masses. I like the concept, but if you're a diehard carnivore, I'm not sure this place will convince you otherwise.  That said, the location is great if you are on the Penn campus looking for a lunch option or staying at the Homewood Suites on 41st and Walnut, and want to try something new. This location does a brisk take-out business, but it's also a casual place to dine alone or with a friend.

They were also more than willing to let me keep it there for a few days since my work schedule overlapped their hours. Once I picked it up I was pleased to find that it actually rode better than when it was brand new, and I didn't end up paying more than what was already covered by the groupon. Keswick does a fast, thorough job while trying to keep it as cheap as possible for the customer, and keeping terrifically upbeat and friendly attitudes. One of the best bike shops in Philly.",tensor(1),"tensor([1], device='cuda:0')"
"I have been to Ru San's several times over the last 6 years, so my star rating is based on my overall experiences. THE PROS: Very big menu with a lot of variety. I usually always order the Crunchy Mui Bueno, Tuna Tempura, and Sea Bass Yakitori. I love the sauce that comes w/ the tempura, and the Sea Bass Yakitori is sooooo delicious it melts in your mouth! I LOVE techno music so the music that is always blaring is super fine with me! The fried ice cream is also to die for! Whatever you do, DON""T forget to order the plum sake! It is served warm and it gives you the best warm, fuzzy feeling ever! (if you drink enough! lol) It's usually pretty lively in there which is also fine with me because I prefer to ALWAYS feel like I'm at a party. THE CONS: Although the food is USUALLY good, I have experienced times where the sea bass yakitori is TINY and the rolls are so huge you can't eat them in one bite. And for anyone who eats sushi rolls you know having to bite into one pretty much makes it fall apart. I've never had anything that actually TASTED bad, though. I have experienced waiters at times who take forever, forget you, and leave your food on the counter 10 min before they bring it to you. A few years back they always used to sing and make  a lot of noise (literrally) for your birthday. 5 years ago they even gave me a $25 giftcard for my birthday when I celebrated there. A couple years ago I made a reservation a few days in advance for my birthday because we were going to have about 10 people in our group. When we got there they had no recollection of the reservation and it still took 20 or so minutes to even get a table. :(  Last couple of years it doesn't seem like they do much for birthdays.  Overall I think Ru San's is a fun place with good sushi and a cool atmosphere. Perfect start to a night of fun!!",tensor(1),"tensor([1], device='cuda:0')"

I settled on a coffee and an egg and cheese sandwich on an English muffin.  The café definitely lives up to its name in that hot beverages are served in red mugs, and the atmosphere is homey and low-key, just like the corner coffee shops we all know and love.  Much to my delight, as I was enjoying my breakfast (which was well prepared, by the way), the very friendly owner (?) Rick made conversation with me and we chatted for a good while, since it seemed to be pretty slow for a Monday morning.

"Don't let the location or the exterior of this little establishment fool you.  We were pleasantly surprised by how clean the place is and how modern the rooms were.

Flat screen TV, cute little decorative touches, and their bathroom was OMG!!!  I want my own home bathroom to look like that!  Beautiful granite counter-tops and granite walls in the shower.The only negative was the strangely scheduled demolition of their parking lot on a Sunday morning at 10am.  I mean, we were up and all but we were asked to move our car and then the noise was just insane.  Thankfully we checked out that day at 11am.  Whoever scheduled that construction work must've had screw loose.  Anyway, you won't be disappointed.  We went on Valentine's Day weekend, so prices were a bit higher.

"My co-workers and I all had a hard time understanding why this hotel receives such mediocre reviews.  The shuttle came as soon as I called, had much needed A/C and the driver chatted non-stop with the other passengers the whole trip about Colorado and snowboarding of which I know nothing.  But that just gave me the advantage when I leapt from the bus and made it to the counter first.  This is another Hilton with online check-in which works quite well.  They found my key waiting and handed it to me, so I was literally only about 3 minutes from the shuttle to the room.  As mentioned in my review of the Bay Café, they have a Happy Hour they call a ""Manager's Reception"" in the 2nd floor restaurant which features a roomy deck you can see through the glass doors and many windows that line the west-facing wall.  The snacks they offer change daily and the day I visited they had out dressings, hummus, fresh raw vegetables, potato chips and goldfish crackers.  But you can disguise these meager offerings as a meal with disproportionate amounts of alcohol to supplement.  The breakfast they offer in the same dining room is leaps and bounds better.  One wall has toast, milk, cereal, coffee and pastries.  The other side of the room is a kitchen that has free made to order omelets (only as flavorful as you pile on the calories), scrambled eggs, sausages, biscuits, gravy and hot cereal.  I can only down a plateful but think of how much you'd normally spend for breakfast in an on-site restaurant hotel.  The rooms are standard, with nothing that stands out from other Hilton locations.  One co-worker had a few of the skyline while my room looked out at the city.  It's right across from the Westshore Mall if you're looking for something to do but Florida cities seem much more driveable than other East Coast cities, so most visitors probably have a car to ferry themselves to anything else Tampa has to offer.",tensor(1),"tensor([0], device='cuda:0')"
"My husband and I trekked from Memphis to St. Louis at the beginning of April for the USWNT soccer game at Busch Stadium. We arrived in St. Louis with a few hours to spare before game time, so we headed over to a burger joint, Bailey's Range, for lunch (I had found it ahead of time via Yelp, naturally). This restaurant was only a few blocks from the stadium and was buzzing with patrons. After fasting for Good Friday, a nice juicy burger accompanied with some fried pickles, french fries, and an ice-cold Coke sounded just right. The space itself was very neat, with large downstairs and upstairs dining areas. There was also an ice cream station at the front of the restaurant, which we sadly did not partake in. The service was a bit slow due to the mad rush of soccer fans that they clearly were not expecting, so we were efficient whenever our waitress came by and ordered everything that we needed at once. We started with the fried pickles appetizer. The batter was very good and I was suprised to see that the dish included different types of pickles. We then each ordered our burgers (me - the basic burger, my husband - the American burger). Both burgers were cooked to our preference and the toppings were nice, but nothing to write home about. The standout dish was the french fries (note - the large french fry is HUGE, two people could easily split the smaller portion). The ketchup accompanying the fries was very interesting - was there ginger in there? Who knows, but it was good! I would definitely recommend this burger place to anyone traveling to St. Louis.",tensor(0),"tensor([0], device='cuda:0')"

Looked at the menu and typical prices for food at a movie. Different from cinebistro as they allow kids before 6pm. $5 beer and $4 bottled water. Go figure!!  Website said $6 popcorn but menu says $7. Strange that they raised price. Didn't they just open?  Anyway it's closer than cinebistro so I'm glad for that.

Word of caution to parents: this place isn't for kids as we learned the hard way since we were planning to eat some appetizers while watching the sunset. The waitresses after ignoring us for a while one of them came to our table and asked us how we got in, and we said: thru the door. And she said how the bouncer let us in? And I said: there was no bouncer. So we were asked to leave, simply like that because we were with a kid/minor.  If the bouncer was doing his job he could have told us that before crossing the door that kids aren't allowed unless you are a hotel guest! Or put a sign at the hotel entrance about it.

It's not too often you're in a restaurant and you feel like you could sit there the whole night drinking wine and eating.  This place and our server did exactly that.  From the starter, to the main entree to the dessert everything was to die for and the service was impeccable!  I started with the tomato soup while my friend started with the lamb meatballs.  The meatballs were AMAZING and the soup warmed me right up.  We both got the vegetable ragout and it was delicious.  I think every other mouthful came with a 'wow that's good' or 'there are so many flavors.'  I did appreciate how it wasn't too salty as well... or at least I couldn't tell it was.  And then dessert....apple bread pudding with brown butter ice cream.  I think that was the name of it anyway.  My friend and I almost came close to licking the plate!

For dinner, my wife ordered the mahi and I had the grouper piccata. Both were great.  After dinner, we almost made a big mistake because we weren't sure if we were going to have dessert. Thankfully, our server, Jen Fig, told us that there was a new pastry chef who makes all the desserts in-house. Jen raved about the chef's newest creation, a lemon meringue cheesecake which I don't even think is on the menu yet.

"I'll start this off by saying I've worked in the food industry as a server, bartender, expo, busser, dishwasher, etc for 10 plus years. I now work with disabled persons trying to help them find employment. We're not supposed to meet them in their home as per company policy. My client, who is disabled, and I have visited this pizzeria a few times per her request because it's close to her house and she feels comfortable meeting there. Today we went in at 1:45pm and I noticed it was busier than usual (typically we go at a time where it is not busy restaurant hours.) Before going to sit down like we normally do, and again this was only our third time here, We were greeted aggressively and immediately by who I assume is the owner. I started to ask ""do you mind if we sit here.."" and was cut off. He said, ""I have a real problem with you coming in here not buying anything and sitting taking up a table for 2-3 hours."" (Mind you, we have never been there the previous 2 times over an hour and 15 minutes - as I have a limited amount of time I am able to work with each client.  There also has been about 15 other open tables in the restaurant each time we were there, including today.) This person responded very hostile and aggressive. Had the gentleman asked politely if I purchased a drink or a slice of pizza we could sit and go about our business, however he met me with an extremely volatile attitude and aggressive choice of words. Again, as someone who's worked in the food industry, I understand how it can be frustrating for someone to come in and sit without purchasing anything. With that said, how this employee decided to treat me in this moment made me and my disabled client extremely uncomfortable. The rudeness was completely unnecessary and being familiar with the industry I wouldn't have minded at all purchasing something from this place in order to sit there for an hour, had I been spoken to appropriately. The part I feel the worst about is how my client was treated. I had to explain to her why ""that man was so rude"". It's unacceptable how me and my client were made to feel today. She's already treated differently in the world and she felt terrible after this interaction. I'm mortified that this had to happen in this way, and this whole situation could have been completely avoided had we been treated like human beings. What the employee was trying to say was completely justified, however we were yelled at and made to feel like we were unwelcome for no reason whatsoever. I will not be entering this restaurant again for obvious reasons, and I encourage anyone who has any empathy for disabled persons to do the same. Again, the way we were treated was completely reprehensible and could have been avoided completely.",tensor(0),"tensor([0], device='cuda:0')"

Today (March 15th) I drove all the way over only to discover a sign on the door stating they will be closed the remainder of the week! This time I checked their Facebook and there was no information regarding the extended closure. In fact it was a bit confusing because they had posts advertising the re-opening and even pictures posted of people eating there for a brunch event just the other day.

My biscuits and gravy was the smallest portion/price I've ever experienced and i think the lid may have come off the salt when they were making the gravy, ugh! Bacon bloody Mary was good as was the bacon. They didn't have any forks so we had to use plastic, absurd for a business that charges for the name on the front.

"Ok,  my initial disappointment has been  somewhat eliviated, but the Opryland Resort is still lacking a world-class resort feel.  Perhaps it's the purpose and theme of the hotel.  There are some really nice amenities,  especially the shopping. The restaurants are somewhat disappointing.  Although many choices,  it kind of feels like different versions of the same choices.  Pricing is a premium,  but food is not. Finally,  I still don't think the resort understands what is necessary to be world-class.  It's not the property,  rooms,  or even the pricing.  It's the lack of that special sense of being taken care of.   As a Marriott/SPG property, benchmark the Phoenician, Camelback  Inn or Desert Ridge in Scottsdale to see how it should be done.",tensor(0),"tensor([0], device='cuda:0')"

I went in looking to cancel my contract -- thinking I just had to give two months notice. I had no idea upon signing the contract in February that it was a year-long commitment. It just wasn't made clear.I ended up paying a bulk price at once to cover my membership without debits each month on my bank account, but that honestly still peeves me a little when I think of Retro. I just think contracts should be made more clear up front.Otherwise, it's a pretty decent gym. $19.99/month, but they have some random bi-yearly charges, too, which would spike up the per month price if you really think about it.

"This was my third visit to the this place, yet it was the first time my burger was even slightly interesting. It was more than that, it was great! I always wanted this place to be awesome, but every burger I ordered was under seasoned and bland. Not to mention the high price! You pay upwards of $10 for a burger patty that is only slightly bigger than a slider and you don't get a side with it. Now I'm willing to pay that when the meat quality is top notch (which I believe theirs is) and when the flavor is amazing (which it hadn't been until yesterday). So, maybe it's time for me to give this place another try.I have actually always been a fan of their fries, their house made sauces and their onion rings. Their ice cream was never really my favorite. I really prefer a creamier ice cream and I feel theirs is on the ice side. However, I think I've come to appreciate their special brand on ice cream and accepted that it's just different. My favorite flavor is cinnamon and my husband really likes the cookies and cream. I got to sample their chai and that was delicious as well!Annoyances worth mentioning:The service! I've always had servers with decent attitudes, but they've never been terribly attentive. I always feel like I'm looking around for them and waiting for them to come back. I don't know if they're understaffed??The noise! This place is super echo-ey and super loud! It made it pretty hard to carry on a conversation. Parking. It's not easy or cheap.Community seating. I've been at the community table two out of my three visits. Both times I was lucky enough not be sat right next to strangers. But it's still nit my favorite style of seating...Over all, I know I'm going to go back to this place.

This is a joke of a theme restaurant and I am embarrassed to be a human when I see them do that hula hoop act in the middle of the bar.  I've been to Hooters twice and I don't plan on ever going again.  I guess it's okay if you just want some beer and wings but aren't there plenty of local bars that do that part better and with more dignity?  Even strip bars have more dignity.

One guy ordered shrimp and grits, I ordered the diver sea scallop app, and the others all ordered barbecue shrimp. My scallops practically melted off my fork. Devine! We all got a spoonful of grits which were beyond fab. And I ate at least 1/3 of my neighbor's shrimp. We had to get extra bread to sop up the goodness left over.

Long long times, tight crowds, lots of dogs and babies. We circled the event trying to pick out which line we were going to devote our entire night to standing in, and decided on the Jamaican truck. After an hour of standing in line, and having other line go-ers friends casually jip us, we finally made it to the front to order only to have the vendor announce they were out of all of my meal options.So you know what I had for dinner the evening of Night Market? A bag of chips from CVS.This event had it's potential. But I guess they were not counting on the ridiculous horde of hungry people.

Bread was ok, but basically a giant unheated roll.  16 bucks for one bite of salad that I spat out, six small shrimp, a bite of bread, and 2 forkfuls of pasta.  The rest went into the trash.  If I hadn't gotten take-out, entire meal would have gone back.Gooey butter cake was ok but not particularly fresh, and t-ravs were edible (but easy to get frozen so hard to mess up).

Another five minutes passed before our overbearing server arrived. She only had two tables. She tried to offer us more time to look over the menu, which we had practically memorized by then. We put in our dinner orders right away. When she gave us our dishes a few minutes later, she disappeared. We were finished our meals and sitting for 8-10 minutes when she reappeared. By that time, she asked about dessert and tried to go get us a menu but again, we knew we couldn't let her out of our sight without losing her forever. When we placed our orders, we agreed to each other to ask for the check when she dropped the desserts. Of course, she had a runner come to our two top with our desserts. One and a half hours for a dinner/dessert for two (no drinks) in a quiet restaurant is absurd.

I took a menu to share with my group, and magically served the 8"" cake to the masses (usually serves 8-10) once I made the grand entrance.   I must admit, I've never spent that much on a cake that size, but the raves that were received and interest in where it came from were proof enough (if not the crumbs in the box) to affirm my decision was a stellar one.

"Several friends and I continued our mini-pub crawl of mixology bars (begun at Franklin Mortgage and Investment Co.) here. Good move!We parked it at the bar and got the show from Sasha, the bartender, who kept up friendly banter with us even as she concocted a variety of beverages throughout the course of our stay. The cocktail menu was fairly extensive, broken down into Prohibition- and Repeal-era drinks, not to mention long lists of bourbons, ryes, and scotches. I ordered an Aviation (a drink I make myself, with my own brandied cherries, but here they do it the right way, all out with Creme de Violette to tint it blue like the sky; Sasha let me take a look at the bottle, perhaps to know that it wasn't some awful curacao!) For another friend she created a drink with Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction's Root liqueur (which is made with the roots and herbs used in old-fashioned root beer), chocolate bitters, seltzer and orange. We also partook of food here: First, duck fat fries (which have been a trend in Chicago, where I live, for at least a year, but I'd never had them; I'd never eaten anything involving duck before this, so now I suppose I have lost my duck fat innocence). These were thick-cut, rich in taste [gratis the duck fat, one presumes], not actually greasy, but definitely better when ordered with the cup of cheese sauce on the side. We also got soft pretzel sticks, which would have been fine but not especially remarkable without the mustard sauce (which had a distinct taste of raspberry, to my mind) pooled in the cup underneath them.Overall, this was a friendly place with fab drinks and great food. I wish it was in my city.",tensor(1),"tensor([1], device='cuda:0')"
"Conceptually awesome! My wife and I popped in early Friday evening for our first visit. The environment left us feeling as though we were at a  beach bar & restaurant. We tried two appetizers: Grilled Shrimp and Smoked Fish Spread. Both were well prepared and delicious. For entrees, Emily had the grilled snapper tacos and I had the gag grouper dinner. Both meals were delicious! The issues the exist can easily be corrected. It is summer and this is an outdoor venue. You order your food at a hut located behind the bar. However, you have to stand in the HOT sun while ordering! A canopy needs to be installed. There is no pricing listed anywhere so you order and then get surprised by what you are asked to pay. What we ordered was well worth what we paid but it would be nice to know what you are spending before you order. The only menu is a series of high-end cocktails all of which sound delicious. However, the bartenders are not adept and creating these wonderful concoctions. So the delivery is not as great as the written word. Suggestion, cocktail napkins or coasters (they won't blow away) and ice. Alcohol melts the ice so load the glass up because the Florida summer heat melts the ice also. The plastic wear is fine and works well enough but the little piece of paper in the package is not sufficient to be called a napkin. Serve and extra ""real"" napkin with the utensils. One thing for sure we will be back but at this price point, a few additional steps need to be taken by management and crew.

Something with the cream, it's light and fluffy! And not too sweet at all!Salted Caramel Cupcake: recommend by staff. It was really good but way too super sweet. One bite and I was done, the icing is just way too rich for my tasting. Bacon Chocolate Chip Cookie: another recommendation by staff. I tasted bacon once throughout the entire cookie. For some reason I don't think bacon in a cookie goes together. Something I didn't care for. Lavender Scone: it was calling my name but I had to ask...if they were moist and not super dry. The girl was right! She told me it was buttery and not dry at all. I hate dry scones. But OMG!!! Out of the world yummy! If I didn't have the lavender scone I'm sure my rating would of been a 3 star.

"As avid brewery connoisseurs and current Nashville locals, we were extremely and pleasantly surprised with our experience at Tennessee Brew Works this evening. It was a dreary, rainy night and as we pulled up we were fairly apprehensive about the string of dark warehouses and quiet alleys. It all changed quickly as we walked into the ""Tennessee Fill Station"" (or some name similar) portion of the building. The fellas working there directed us to the ""Tennessee Tap Room"" (or some name similar) portion of the building that overlooked 2 stories into the ""Tennessee Brew Works"" (or some name similar) portion of the building where the brewing takes place. I've added the specifics because this is the first group audacious and clever enough to pull off all three portions under one roof.... and to still comply with Tennessee's archaic liquor laws! If sticking it to the man isn't enough reason for you to check it out.... keep reading. The tap room is super neat and cleverly laid out with patios, long & community-oriented tables, a flying bridge or ""catwalk"" and a steady stream of live, local music. It's largely non-smoking (which is enough to convince me to cross the bridge from East Nashville) and has a few TVs to cater to the football crowds. Biggest fortes:- The staff is amazing. The smiles and enthusiasm when they start talking about their beer are a sweet relief. They're excited! They're adventurous! They aren't pretentious. Real People.- The beers are fresh & different. They keep it local. They aren't afraid to venture from the norm. They add their own zing and flair.... and for that, I respect them.- They appreciate the food & beer pairing concept. They're bringing in great food to compliment their brews. It's a movement.If you've managed to read all of that rambling- you can ignore any other reviews and just go ahead and get there.",tensor(1),"tensor([1], device='cuda:0')"

"Well I read the other reviews and I have to disagree, I found the store delightful and a welcome change from typical Goodwill. I talked to the young ladies working and said what a pleasant experience it was shopping there. They told me the items offered are taken from overstock that would typically be warehoused. They do not pull from existing merchandise at GWs but from items that would be warehoused because there is no room for them in the GW store. So for those who still wish to treasure hunt at GW this does not preempt that thrill.For me, though, I liked that the items were somewhat more selective than a typical GW. I found three shirts which on any given day I would look at 3 different GWs around town and not find one. My total cost on them was $19.25. An Old Navy, Lee Rider and Tommy Bahama ($10 of the $19). For me it was more akin to consignment shopping and priced accordingly. I definitely think it's worth a look on any given day.

OMG! i would choose this meal as my pre-execution fare if i were on death row.  first off, the watermelon salad was ridiculously delicious. there were pieces of watermelon, some radishes, some other vegetable that i can't recall right now, and slices of some unpronounceable white cheese. those ingredients are kind of exciting on their own but what set that dish apart was the freaking oil-based dressing. i don't know what they put on top of that salad but it just made the whole dish come together.the roasted bell pepper was ENORMOUS. i didn't realize how big and filling that dish would be. the bell pepper had some mix of lentils, raisins?, cheese, and whatever extra deliciousness the chef decided to throw in to blow my mind. accompanying the bell pepper was some kind of tomato ragout with a dollop of soft, i'm guessing, goat cheese. whatever it was it complimented the bell pepper fantastically.all told, the total cost wasn't ridiculous for both items (i think i paid almost 40 usd with tax and tip.) given this experience, that chef can be soup nazi if he wants.",tensor(1),"tensor([1], device='cuda:0')"

"Eclipse Pizza defines what a tasty pie + gourmet toppings is.  The bicycle friendly house-like restaurant is nestled in a neighborhood like commercial area on the corner of McCarran and Mayberry Dr. Besides just pizzas they also have gourmet salads and of course, calzones.On my first time there, we got calzones to go: Mine = Hawaiian w/ pineapple, mushrooms(normally ham), macadamia nuts, pesto sauce & mozziMy Pals' = The Grecian w/ Kalamata Olives, roasted peppers, roasted garlic, tomato sauce & feta cheeseOn the second time, I took 2 little ones aged 6 & 10 where we went simple and got half cheese and half artichoke and chicken.  I think this was where I really noticed the savory-delicious taste of Eclipse Pizza's Red sauce and their salads.

"I find it hard to believe there are so many people with such low standards when it comes to the Daily Bread.It is a ripoff of St. Louis Bread Co/Panera Bread, which in of itself I don't mind at all.  I have eaten multiple times at the Daily Bread and have yet to have an enjoyable experience.  The food is so-so at best.  Their sandwiches are basic and lack any real flavor.  I also tried the BBQ Chicken pizza and it was okay.  I certainly wouldn't steer anyone away from this place based on the food.  The food is basic and simple, not bad but also nothing great.My biggest qualm with the Daily Bread is the service.  The majority of the workers seem utterly uninterested in helping out.  There was a line of about 6 people and one person at the register.  There was no sense of urgency to help any of the customers in line.  We waited for a good 5-6 minutes to put an order in.  After receiving our cups to get our drinks we looked for a clean place to sit and eventually settled on a table top that was the least dirty of the tables available.  There were plenty of open spots but it just appeared as though there was lots of trash left behind.  Does anyone bus these tables?I anticipate that people are responsible for cleaning up after themselves, but it appeared as though the tables hadn't been effectively cleaned in a while.  There was also some trash on the floor that hadn't been addressed as well.The order number was called and the order was only halfway completed.  When we asked which sandwich was ours, we were basically ignored as the girl put up two more orders.   After another few minutes the rest of the order came up and we began to eat.  I tried both items and as I stated before, both were okay.  The problem is that the food was just unable to make up for the lack of organization, the slow speed at which we were served, or the cleanliness of the restaurant.After 3 attempts, I'm writing the Daily Bread off and won't return.  I'd rather go to St. Louis Bread Co, get the same level of food, but in a clean environment and a timely setting.",tensor(0),"tensor([0], device='cuda:0')"
"This sushi restaurant was horrible.  First, when we walked in we were POINTED to our table, not actually walked to it.  No one smiled at us, and we were completely ignored throughout our stay.  We had 3 different people serving us, so we had no idea who our waitress was.  No one explained to us that the only option at ZEN was all you can eat, so when we ordered only 4 small items and received a bill for $56.00, we were astonished.  The waitresses simply ""dumped"" the food to our table....No smiles, no asking who the food was for.  I had to get up from our table to ask for our bill, as we were completely ignored and sat there forever waiting for someone to serve us.  I ended up complaining to one of the waitresses who laughed throughout the few minutes I complained.  DO NOT go to this restaurant....Overall a HORRIBLE experience!!!",tensor(0),"tensor([0], device='cuda:0')"
"Excellent food and bar. Slow service.A friend and I stopped here during an evening of bar hopping in the CBD. We were seated promptly and given our menus, which are half-French, half-English. Not a big deal for anyone who can read French and/or has been living in Louisiana for a reasonable amount of time, but definitely something tourists should be wary of. I didn't have any alcohol because I was the designated driver, but I can say that their drink menu is extensive, and the bar was packed from the moment we arrived until the moment we left. This restaurant's biggest strength is it's food. I tasted their crab bisque, and had Poulet Grand-Mère as my entrée. Both were excellent. The latter arrived in a wide cast-iron bowl, which I'm sure has a more proper name, but was an interesting touch nonetheless.The service was why I gave this restaurant 4/5 instead of 5/5. Most of the wait staff seemed to be interns from culinary school. The handful we dealt with were very friendly, but would do well to be a little more attentive. For example, the server who brought us our desserts ran off before we could ask for spoons to eat the dessert with. In summary, a good dining experience, but I think I would rather continue exploring new restaurants in the area before returning.",tensor(1),"tensor([1], device='cuda:0')"
"Went here today and it was terrible. Sam is always character which is sometimes entertaining, and the lunch special is priced nicely- but thats the only good I have to say about this place. I ordered the california and nashville rolls (i wanted the spider roll but I guess he was out of crab, or didnt want to make it) and my friend got spicy tuna and something with shrimp. Sam totally messed up the order. The spicy tuna ended up with my california rolls but i just dove in, unaware of the mixup. I cant even handle mild salsa so when i ate the tuna, it was so hot, i almost threw up, started crying and sweating- it was an awful experience. I tried to eat a california roll but my mouth hurt so bad, i couldn't taste anything and I totally lost my appetite. We didnt even bother trying to get sam to fix the order.It was a terrible experience all because sam didnt write any of the three seperate orders down that he took at the same time.

"It's more of a solid 3.5 stars.  This was our first time at the jersey location.  It was very spacious, clean, and empty.  Well, it was a Tuesday night and there were only about 4 other patrons there; we had the whole back room to ourselves.  We ordered quite a bit for two.  We started with scallion pancakes, meh i've had better.  It was nothing special.  The guy had the spicy beef noodle soup, beef was braised as well.  The broth was delicious and spiciness level was a 5.  When he asked the waiter if the size was comparable to pho the waiter did not have a clue to what pho was.  You work in an asian resto my dude!  Granted this is not a viet joint, but you should be well rounded about asian cuisine overall.  Anyway, the dan dan noodle is a staple when dining at Han's, the spiciness level was a 6 and they accommodated me by not adding meat to it.  I also ordered the spicy cucumber, spiciness level was a 6.  After one helping i was over it.  The garlic overpowered the rest of the flavosr as i kept munching on it.  My eyes locked in on the salt and pepper shrimp entree so i had to order it.  I love this dish.  The minced pepper and onion just heightens the flavor of the shrimp.  Shame that it was on the pricey side, $19.95.  I think there were only about 10 pieces of shrimps.  The guy had a chicken entree that he liked, nothing special.  We ended up having leftovers cause we wanted to try different things.  I think next time i'll just stick to the lunch menu or take out.",tensor(0),"tensor([0], device='cuda:0')"

You don't pay at the table - they ring you up by the door to try and get people in and out fast which seems to work because the line is always moving fairly fast.

BEST MARGHERITA PIZZA EVER!! I originally tried this place after buying a Groupon 6+ years ago. My wife is a vegetarian so we tend to always get a Margherita.

"I normally LOVE Bailey's Range, but tonight was extremely disappointing. Our server seemed really nice at first to our table of four, but as the night went on, we saw her paying more attention to the table of four behind us. She was attentive to them, and checking in on them regularly. At one point we were out of water. Someone else had stopped to bring us more water. We had to flag down our server to get another drink for my friend, but she left so quickly after that, that we were not able to order for the rest of the table. While we waited, we noticed the table on the other side of us got all of their food...they were seated about 20 minutes after us. Our server could not be found for awhile, so my friend got the attention of another worker to see if she could check in on our order...this was over an hour after we were seated. We were seated at 7:33, but did not get our food until 8:45. She did not ask if we needed anything else. Our server never checked in and asked us how our food was. She never apologized that it was busy and that our food took so long. She did ask the four guys behind us many times, and I even heard her say they were getting 16 oz beers for the price of a 9 oz. Wow...how did they get that deal? One of my friends was getting tired, so we decided to ask for the check shortly after we ate our burgers. Our server flew right past our table to the table behind us to ask if they needed anything, then she started to walk away. My friend yelled her name 3 times to get her to come back so we could ask for the check. Still no apologies, no asking how our food or experience was. Personally, I was ready to walk out. But my friends were kind and still left a tip and did not make a ruckus. I completely understand that you folks were slammed with the Halloween convention in town, but it's no excuse for poor customer service, especially to those that live downtown and frequent your restaurant and recommend it to others. It's going to take me a long time to go back, if I ever do. I certainly will not be recommending it anytime soon. Sad and disappointed on many levels.",tensor(0),"tensor([0], device='cuda:0')"

My son and I had something called the wildflower triple that had scrambled eggs, bacon, and a waffle.  The waffles were very yummy were tender with the perfect golden crisp to them.  The bacon was a great balance of crispy without being over cooked.  Prices seemed reasonable to me, most items in the $5-8 range if I remember correctly.  Mine was $7.75 I think.One last note is that they had good portion sizes.  The portion sizes are filling, without being super sized.  I was afraid when I order something called a triple it would be WAY too much food (even though the price was inline with other items on the menu).

It, like the Uptown Delachaise, which I also visited on my most recent trip to the Crescent City, is a gastropub/winebar with small plates and a decent selection of wine and draft beers.Be advised that the plates are indeed quite small.  If you're starving, I'd say you could easily put away three of them yourself.  My friend and I had two each, plus dessert, and weren't super full when we left.  Seating is also limited and the seats by the door were absolutely freezing!  It was a warm evening in late November, but the doors were open and cold air was blowing on us.  Eventually we moved to the bar when two seats opened up there.You order at the bar, which seems to somehow work better here than it did at Delachaise.  The food runner was sweet as pie!  There is an impressive vegetarian portion of the menu, of which we sampled the feta fries, falafel bites, housemade rigatoni, and miticana gratin, all of which were totally yum.

"Back in my hay-day, I was a pretty built dude. I used to play lacrosse. (Sure, I rode the bench, but I still practiced like a winner.) I used to strength train with a former Romanian World Cup soccer player who looked eerily like John Travolta from Pulp Fiction on many, many steroids. (True story; 2006 was a weird year for me.) I used to eat right, drink plenty of water, and take all my essential vitamins. I was young, virile, and full of energy, ready to live a long and eventful life free of prescription medications.And then I discovered beer.Years of the sauce coupled with limited time for exercise (Damn you, soul-crushing job!) made me into a pretty average, pretty chunky little twenty-something. Recently, I decided to do something about it. I began researching the plethora of gyms scattered throughout our fair city, only to discover that waiting tables could never afford me any of them. I heard great things about some of the bigger chains (*cough* SWEAT *cough*) but I simply could not afford their monthly rates. Then an angel in the form of a buddy from work told me about an incredible deal in Northern Liberties. Given how much I missed being in shape, I had to check it out, and I did just that.I've been going 4 times a week ever since. Now, before we talk about the machines, the size of the place, or the classes, let's head off on another path. If you (yes, you) are a follower of my few reviews on here, you may have noticed a theme: I have a secret love for personality displayed in the staff of the spots I frequent. (If you noticed, gold star for you. If not, accept it as absolute truth and carry on reading.) Anyhow, the first thing you notice upon entering City Fitness is the staff. And this staff has definite personality. Everyone smiles. Everyone greets you. If they remember you from the day before, they let you know. If they saw you doing a weird exercise, they ask you about it. Here's the important part, kiddies: THEY MAKE YOU FEEL WELCOME. One of the biggest problems I've encountered in the gyms I've attended in the past has been a general feeling of indifference emanated by the workers. They didn't care whether or not I was there, and I was therefore usually too intimidated or put off to ask them for assistance. Often, this little indifference is what caused me to cancel my membership. Somehow, I don't foresee that happening at City Fitness.The gym itself is huge. A converted warehouse, it has a little bit of everything. The main room consists of the weight section (combination of free weights, benches, and varying machines), the cardio section (50-something pieces of cardio equipment, each with their own LCD TV attached), a stretching/aerobic section (that could admittedly be bigger), and the smoothie bar, which boasts some of the best original recovery shakes I've ever had. They even create specialty recipes for the holidays! Trust me, you're sorry you missed the Thanksgiving Pumpkin Pie shake.Aside from the main room, City Fitness also has dedicated spinning and yoga rooms, each adorned appropriately, as well as a multi-purpose room used for many of the classes offered.Wait, did he just say classes? Yeah, he did. CF has a lot of them. They offer the traditional fare, like the aforementioned yoga and spinning, as well as some more cutting edge classes, like kettle bells and core-centric bridal bootcamps. (Not my cup o' tea, but hey) Different trainers handle different classes, each according to their own personal specialty, and from what I've seen, they kick your ass.Now, that last sentence implies that I don't actually take the classes offered. I don't, and the reason for that is because they cost extra money when added to your monthly membership. Ah, the catch... Actually, most things at CF add a few dollars to your membership fee to utilize fully. Classes, towel service, and locker rentals all increase your very reasonable starting fee and make it... still incredibly reasonable. Seriously, I've done the math, and even if I were to add the fee for taking classes to my membership, I'd be paying less than a basic membership at Sweat. That, friends, is superb.So, if you've been following along, you've come to realize that City Fitness is a large, friendly wellness center with a little bit of everything for everyone that won't break the bank and is easy to get to. (It's literally 40 paces from the Spring Garden El stop.) The question is, with this information in hand, why the hell aren't you there yet? When you do go, look for me. I'll be the guy lost in his own reflection in the giant mirrors.",tensor(1),"tensor([1], device='cuda:0')"

Usually juicy and easy to crack.Calamari- some of the best calamari I've ever had, the sweet chili sauce on top is so delicious.Salmon meal- I was hesitant about this but surprisingly the salmon was pretty good. The potatoes were not so great but edible nonetheless.Drinks- $4 glasses of wine, need I say more? Overall, I am an extremely picky eater and this place borders on a 3 star (food wise) but you cannot beat $4 glasses of wine, tons of seating, and huge flat screens.",tensor(1),"tensor([1], device='cuda:0')"
"Oh hell yes. So good!I usually would not drive so far out of my way for a restaurant, but we came here with some family and I am so glad we did! I'd never been to Dunedin prior to this, and what a cute little place it is! Adorable little downtown area that you'd never expect from such a small town. Anywho, Kelly's. When we went, it was jam packed. I believe the wait was 30-45 minutes, so it would certainly behoove you to call ahead and make a reservation. The service was good for how busy it was. Not super quick, but friendly and punctual enough. You can only expect so much when they're packed to the gills. The food was phenomenal, and priced pretty fairly for the quality. Perhaps a teensy tiny bit overpriced compared to similar restaurants, but overall can't complain there. I had the seafood pasta and hoooooly cow. Cannot wait to go back for more. It was absolutely decadent, and I'm not even a fan of pasta. If you're already a pasta lover this will knock your socks off. The pasta was so tender and the dish had such a great, deep seafood flavor- not weak or briny at all. My mouth is watering a bit just thinking about it. My husband had the baby back ribs and they were devoured in a matter of minutes, so I would guess that means they were good. I can't remember off the top of my head what the other diners had, but I do remember everyone was very, very happy with their meals. Highly recommended!",tensor(1),"tensor([1], device='cuda:0')"
"This is a milestone review for me on Yelp.  I had been struggling with which one to chhose.  I decidede to make it Redemption.  This was seriously one of the best meals of my ENTIRE life.  This review was from about 2 months ago.  Sorry it is a little dated.  Such as life.  The setting is an old church.  It is really a beautiful surrounding for a restaurant.  Although I am an old church architecture nerd.  It was really cool to look around.   The service was incredible.  I was hear as part of a group of 7 other characters, several were part of the NOLA restaurant scene.  We wanted a good time with the meal and they provided it!   Paneed smoked soft shell crab a la Christian.  I was not fortunate enough to have enjoyed the original.  I can not comment on the faithfulness to the founders recipe.  I can say this there is no highe calling for a soft shell crab than to be cold smoked and fried in preparation for this dish.  On to your 77 virgins and mecca for you!  But I experienced heaven eating this.  Seafood stuffed filet of fish a la Christian's - This was superlative.  Again did not try the original, but the mirliton and seafood stuffing was heavenly, and more importantly improved the taste of the fresh flounder rather than competing for the spot light!   The combination was quite possibly one of the 10 best meals of my life.  If you have been here, you should try it!",tensor(1),"tensor([1], device='cuda:0')"

"Our family of four stayed two nights at the Palm Pavilion Inn a couple of weeks ago. This was our first stay at this hotel but after reading reviews, we had a good idea what to expect. First of all, this hotel is NOT a resort. It's an older, small, budget friendly, 3 story hotel that has been remodeled in a sort of funky, art-deco style and is an easy walk to the beach. Our room was small with two comfortable double beds but well appointed with flat screen tv, mini fridge and excellent wifi. The room is a little tight for four people but would be perfect for two. Coffee in the lobby. Friendly staff. Hotel furnishes beach towels and you can charge the beach chairs to the room. They even had some beach toys for our daughter to borrow.  I was told that for more money, the efficiency rooms are larger. We would definitely stay here again but would try out one of the larger rooms. If you're looking to stay at a chain type hotel or resort, this isn't for you. If you're looking for a small, family-owned, well appointed hotel, give Palm Pavilion.",tensor(1),"tensor([1], device='cuda:0')"

"This is one of those places that continue to surprise me here in New Orleans -- that a convenience store food mart serves Vietnamese food. And it seems pretty legit. I discovered the place when I did a banh mi search on Yelp. I was surprised, but probably would not have made the effort to go if it wasn't located right next door to the Aristocat Nail Salon, where I had a Living Social coupon for a mani pedi. The owner of the salon is Vietnamese and I trust that she knows her food and she highly recommended the place. So far, I've only had a banh mi there, which is a bit different than other ones I've had. I usually go with the standard cold cut combo, but Eat Well's is overstuffed with barbecue pork. It 's really delicious, but it can also be a tad bit greasy, but you know, sometimes grease is good! The people who work there are really nice and you can call in and they'll have it ready for pick up! And they don't seem to mind when I ask for extra pickled carrots and daikon.

There is a bar to chill out and have a beer while you wait, but since it was packed we didn't want to stand awkwardly next to a table and wait for a slice to come out. Interior is nice. I appreciate how clean and well-kept it looks.I think the fact that this place is busy means it must be doing something right.

"I came in here the other night for a  post-show snack after seeing a ESO performance at the Winspear. The main reason we chose this location was because it was close to the Winspear, and open late (until 11:30pm on Friday and Saturday). I don't have any strong criticisms of the restaurant. I suppose, if anything, the menu may have seemed a little bit over-priced - at least for what I ordered. I had a Caesar salad with three 'jumbo' shrimp on it, which cost $15. The portion size did not seem to justify the cost and the jumbo shrimp were fairly average in their size, but the flavours were good and the ingredients were fresh. My friend had a soup, which looked and smelled absolutely amazing, and at $6 it didn't seem too unreasonable. She also had the smoked salmon Carpaccio, which looked very appetizing with its thick slices of dark rye bread and generous slices of smoked salmon and capers. The also had a couple of interesting beers on their menu that we were keen to try.I think if you're going to a show in the area and looking for a spot to get a drink or a snack afterward, this is not a bad option. Their menu at that time of night had an interesting mix of appetizers and desserts that seemed to provide something to suit most tastes.I'm assuming Normand's Bistro must be connected to the Normand's restaurant which is on Jasper Avenue. Of interest, I have heard that Normand's took over the brunch menu that had formerly been offered at the Glenora Bistro.",tensor(0),"tensor([1], device='cuda:0')"

It's plain to see how much he loves what he does.He could easily just have swapped out the links as fast as possible, charged me $20, and been back to whatever he was doing before. Instead, he engaged me in conversation about the watchmaker, whether I owned any other automatic watches, what not to do while wearing it - apparently chain-sawing is a bad idea ;-) - whether to get a winder for it, how often to get it serviced (by the maker, not by him), how to minimize corrosion from salt water, who manufactured the movement, and more. After he was done, he pulled out a couple of nice watches from his own cabinet -- not to sell them, just to show how the different movements worked -- and told a few stories about other watches that had come through his door over the years.After I'd imposed on some 45 minutes of his time, he charged me less than he originally quoted me for the link removal, gave me a copy of a watch enthusiast magazine he had lying around, and sent me on my way with a smile.

"I had been reluctant to try this place because I had several bad experieinces at the eatery that used to occupy this space and was afraid that perhaps they had just tried to rebrand themselves as Enzo's.  Well in the mood for a chicken cutlet with some greens I decided to give it a try. The sandwich was pretty good and they have the mexican soda's (coke, sprite, and fanta orange) at a very reasonable price for center city standards.  The availability of soda's out of glass bottles and made with real sugar instead of corn syrup plus the good sandwich is probably enough to make me a regular visitor at least every couple of weeks.if you dont already know about mexican soda's do yourself a favor and go find one, why not stop here and pick up a chicken cutlet sandwich and wash it down with a delicious and refreshing soda in a glass bottle made out of real sugar",tensor(1),"tensor([1], device='cuda:0')"

I know pharmacist job are stressful and boring so their performance is not always smooth, but at this location I encountered not one but two's, and they're dumb.  First's, she didn't consider the time zone difference, I transferred from the PAC time zone, and the small mom & pop store opens at 10 Am PAC, means 1 PM EST. She's so upset and certainly that the phone number I gave her was absolutely was a bad number. I called myself, they have a recordings telling their hours. What they're missing is telling the hours are PAC, though I told CVS their address as well. Besides who buy medicines out of state? Except traveling?  Second's, a young pharmacist didn't know much has to ask some body and forgot to answer my very basic question ""Does my plan covers?"". When I asked, shows his impoliteness.

"Stopped by here since it was across the street from where we were staying. The only reason this place is still in business is because of the location. We were greeted upon arrival and sat quickly...nothing afterwards was quick. It took at least 15 minutes before for someone came to the table to greet us and ask what we wanted to drink. We ordered at that time as well since we had plenty of time to look at menus. I'm a mahi mahi fan so I ordered it as a sandwich and fried with cole slaw. I'll put it this way, I was so disappointed in it I left an entire piece (came with 2 decent sized cuts of mahi) but the breading was the worst I've ever had, the slaw was mayo based not vinegar based as the waitress stated, and it was possibly the most bland food I've ever had in my 38 years of existence. My friend had clam basket that was mostly fries and equally unimpressive. Son had spaghetti that he said tasted like nothing. Daughter had burger that she said tasted fine and she ate all of it. The waitress didn't seem to know much about anything she served and consistently gave two craps about who ordered what. She would bring out something we asked for and would hand it to someone else at the table. She seemed confused as hell. Long story short this place could have been in our building and I wouldn't eat here again. If you see this place full or a good review I guarantee it's from local clientele.

I can't ever imagine what would happen if I let her babysit my future kid. So I went online and booked an appointment with Katarina. She is amazing and wonderful in every way! Very friendly and patient. One of the best pet groomers there, I would highly recommend her because not only did she do a great job of trimming... what's left of my dog's facial hair but she also made him look super cute and clean.

"Unfortunately, I'm NOT happy after coming to this salon yet again. I got a message from the owner saying he'd like to have me come in to receive a FREE service because they previously ruined my hair. So, I thought since he's the owner my hair would turn out good but I was wrong. I'm really unhappy with this whole experience. I showed him multiple photos on google of what I wanted done to my hair which was a lot of blonde. I told him I do not want any ORANGE in my hair as I wanted a ""white blonde"". He said you won't have any orange in your hair. I have a message from him the OWNER saying I would receive a FREE service if I deleted my previous review. He should of NEVER offered a free service if it wasn't really free! So, I said how much because I thought I was getting my hair done for free. He said since your hair is long and thick you'll have to pay for the hair color and ""medicine"" but he won't charge me for his time. I said ok how much he said $80. He said it would cost me $180 if he didn't give me a discount which is very pricey. He put a lot of highlights on my hair and worked quickly as he seemed to want to rush on my hair which I do not like. My hair is important to me, I don't want my hair to fall out. He said this medicine he's gonna put on my hair is $50 for a treatment and that I needed it because of the blonde going on my hair which I know any coloring is damaging and blonde is very damaging but he said he charges everyone who gets hair color for this so called medicine which they mix into the color you dye your hair. You can purchase the entire set online (3 bottles) for $75 which is supposed to give you like 15 applications so he's definitely charging a lot of money! He only put No.1 on my hair and not No.2 or No.3. He also had a lady (the receptionist) wash out my hair? Ok, even though she was nice why would he have her do that when she said she knows nothing about hair because I asked if she's styling my hair and she said she doesn't do hair and I wouldn't want her to do my hair. As I was waiting there was a lady next to me, she got her hair cut and a perm. She was done but she wasn't happy, she told the lady she didn't like the hair cut and she had her style it more and trim off a little more but the lady still wasn't happy. The girl told the client when she washes her hair it will be better.. um how? I know she left very unhappy! Also the lady behind me was getting her hair cut and when he (the owner) was done cutting her hair she looked in the mirror and wanted it different and styled different so that made me have to wait longer but 2 clients were not happy and also myself. That's not a good look TJ nail and spa! I had a towel on my head and waited about 30 mins just to get my hair blow dried because he was cutting another clients hair. I seen orange roots, I was mad!!! He finally came over and I said I don't like the orange color on my roots, can you put a toner on my hair and he said it's not orange it's the lighting. The lighting?! It wasn't the lighting! He proceeds to blow dry hair and then starts straighten it without asking me if I wanted it straightened or curled, you are supposed to pick how you want your hair styled. At that point I knew my hair wasn't what I wanted and it wasn't gonna be fixed even if I wanted it too. I just sat there in the hair, mad and yet again very disappointed! I looked in the mirror and seen my hair damaged and brittle, orange and brassy and not even close to what I wanted. There goes my money down the drain, yet again. I will not be back to get my hair ruined and he made me delete my previous review which was also 0-1 stars before I left his salon but I had to write this one, this is real, this is honest, beware of getting your hair completely ruined and nothing close to what you want! Like I said I showed the OWNER multiple photos and I stated I did NOT want any orange on my hair but I did have orange on my hair, I didn't get what I wanted like he said, he said he doesn't mess up, he's been doing hair for years. As a salon owner I think he should take the time to really do what the client wants and achieve what the client wants done to their hair, if the workersowner would do that then there shouldn't be any bad reviews but there is so that shows you they do not care, not even the owner cares. They just want to rush and get done to get paid, they don't care if the customer is happy or not. There are more bad reviews from people going to this salon and having horrible experiences but he is bribing people to delete their bad reviews because he told me the bad reviews is hurting his business which is why people do reviews, to let people know this place is awesome or this place is horrible, beware, stay away. I do reviews to let people know the good, the bad and the ugly. I do reviews anywhere and I'm always 100% honest.

"This tour was awesome! My friend scheduled this tour in advance for my group of 5 our first night staying in the French quarter. Out of all the things I was told to do in NOLA, going on a haunted tour was the top of our list! We met the tour guide on the corner of a busy area outside a small grocery store. The only thing I might say that was confusing was the other groups that were doing a haunted tour the same time we were and were meeting in the same vicinity. We approached the other group by accident and said we were there for the 5 in 1 tour, the man who for the other tour company told us we were in the wrong place and made very negative comments about our tour guide and the company we had signed up for. Honestly it just made HIS company look bad that he would say that to someone. Anywho, the tour was awesome-not going to give any of it away because the stories are best told by the Bone Lady herself. She was so animated and knowledgeable and while other reviewers have said negative comments about the tour, they probably just weren't paying attention (which is hard to do on a Friday night in the French quarter) At the very end of the tour our group approached the bone lady to tell her how much we enjoyed the tour, she told us about her cemetery tour which was taking place on Sunday. We signed up with her right then and there! SERIOUSLY go on both of these tours, you won't regret it! One more comment about the negative reviews, you'll notice a couple people say it's boring: it's not!

Seats were a lot cheap than both citified and yankee stadium and the drive home that late at night was not that bad.I recommend a visit here if you are in the area. Great food and great views of the field from almost any seat.  Another cool fact about this philly arena is that the other team stadium are right there, PRETTY much on the same block.  IT is like if in New York, we had madison square garden, giants stadium and citified all lined up next to each other basically a three block radius.

"I would use all the ink in Yelps pen to compliment this establishment.  This is a perfect example of price balance, speedy / accurate / polite service, hard working cooks, cleaner silverware than Sam Witches and Such, and good food.The special for under $3 M-F is 2 eggs with your choice of hashbrowns and toast or a list of other sides.  I've tried this with grits, hashbrowns, pancakes, biscuits and gravy, white toast, and bacon - all are absolutely perfectly cooked and served to you in less than 5 minutes.These are the fastest cooks I've seen.The waitresses are fast and polite, not overbearing.  This brings me to a delicate situation:I ALWAYS TIP THEM MORE THAN 40% AND I RECOMMEND YOU DO TO.Allow me to explain:  I happily tip just over 20% at Sullivans and Flemmings, even with a bottle of Symmetry by Rodney Strong, when the service is good.  I tip over 20% when the service is good at any restaurant.  If I tip 20% here, the waitress get 60 cents = no bueno.  She runs around for a heck of a lot more than that.  (In fact, I donate 60 cents every day to a child in another country that I don't even know).  So, I usually tip between 50 - 100% of the check here, and I implore you - if they give you good service, consider it please.Back to the review...A+++ on Ebay, thumbs up from Siskel and Ebert and 5 Stars on Yelp.

She even told me that he was a great patient- funny and cheerful.  She told me to have a seat and that he'd be out soon.  He was out in approximately 5 minutes happy and mostly pain-free from the injection he received.

"After years of living here (and prompted by some drinking the night before), I finally decided to try Bui's for breakfast.  Everyone has been telling me that their breakfast sandwiches can't be beat.  Sadly, they can.  Maybe I got the wrong thing (and by reading the reviews, it sure seems like it), but I found Bui's to be lackluster.I will say that for 3.25, I got an enormous warm hoagie filled with eggs, bacon, a smidge of cheese, with some salt, pepper, and ketchup to taste.  The cheese was barely there, the added salt and the saltiness of the bacon was overpowering, and the bread was so doughy and thick it took over the whole sandwich.  This would have tasted better if I was hungover or super drunk, not relatively sober on a Thursday morning.Overall, I think I just ended up getting the wrong thing, but  I really wasn't impressed.  At least it's cheap.",tensor(0),"tensor([0], device='cuda:0')"
Made an online reservation and was seated promptly. Seat was for four and they put two tables together near the bar. It was noisy but that's to be expected on a Saturday night. Our server was wonderful and the food arrived on time. We had three chicken and one veg entrees. The food was absolutely delicious. I highly recommend street noodles with some chefs hot sauce. But make sure to get a reservation or you'll have to wait 30mins.,tensor(1),"tensor([1], device='cuda:0')"

"Just tried the newly opened Wheel Cafe in Dunedin. Let me start with the positives. I liked the set-up & decor. I prefer a small menu, which they deliver on. Better to do a few things well, than a lot of things meh or bad. It serves both breakfast & lunch & even though they were into their lunch menu, they were willing to do breakfast for me. The waitress was pleasant, but the owner?? hoovered a bit too much.I opted for a burger & a bowl of their soup of the day, Potato Leek. What I am about to say is meant for constructive purposes & not to be taken as digs. If you are going to offer up trendy food, you need to be better at seasoning your dishes & food temps. The potato leek soup was bland & had no distinctive potato or leek flavor. The burger, ordred medium, came out more rare than medium and also lacked favor. Chips on the side also lacked salt. If you want to appeal to customers who can appreciate your menu, please up your salt & pepper game. And your cook temps.",tensor(0),"tensor([0], device='cuda:0')"

"It was only my first time here. It was an okay experience. The scallops I had were a bit more salty than I expected though. Otherwise, the deals are great. I happen to have come here on a Friday where they had $2-$3 specials on drinks. This used to be Mangroves, but now under this new ownership, the scene is a lot more casual and beachy than before. I liked it for its laid-back environment. They offer you free bacon at your table the way most restaurants offer free bread!",tensor(1),"tensor([1], device='cuda:0')"
"This is a great market. The beat I've been to in the city. The mixture of stalls is wonderful, between fresh vegetables, meat, eggs, as well as farm produce like cheese, honey, and cider, and baked goods, fresh teas and coffees (available iced for those summer days). The Big Cheese is great -- there's always a line of people hungry for possibly the beat grilled cheese I've ever tasted. I also enjoyed scones and shortbread from Queen's Cuisine. Bread from Companion Bakery is a must, as are popsicles from Whisk. There's a great atmosphere here on a Saturday morning. I also can recommend the free yoga (with a donation). A great teacher and good atmosphere.",tensor(1),"tensor([1], device='cuda:0')"
"Fantastic, I repeat fantastic place to go for breakfast or brunch. We were steered here by 2 different locals, a bar tender and a fellow working in a hot sauce shop. The grits, andouille sausage, bacon were all perfect. The grits in particular.....we came back a few days later and had their breakfast burrata. It was spectacular. Deconstructed to its individual parts then allowing you to put each bite together however you like. So unbelievably good.......we will definitely be back next time in town!!",tensor(1),"tensor([1], device='cuda:0')"
"I think if I could, I would give Zen Yai a 3.5 stars, but alas, c'est la vie. The prices for their curry are excellent, at less than $12. Zen Yai is a tiny place, which is both good and bad. Good if you don't have to wait, because it is nice and cozy, but bad if enough people eat here on a given evening -- because you may just have to wait a while.I like the decor a lot, and the use of colors. The tables and plates are full of refreshingly bright colors. The service was fine, and the food was at our table in no time.My Pineapple curry was excellent! And the rice is served in the shape of a pyramid, which is fun. All that being said, my girlfriend had a less than pleasurable experience. She is a seasoned green curry lover, and was disappointed with their green curry offering.",tensor(1),"tensor([1], device='cuda:0')"

"Perfect New Orleans experience! Live music, great food and drinks!There are refrigerators with cheeses, beer, water, and white wines. Reds as well as some whites/champagnes are displayed around the room. Plan on getting their early to secure a table and chairs. Next to the register there are buckets for ice to keep drinks cool. We were looking to try something new and the staff is well versed in their inventory and gave us great advice.Great ""pick your own"" cheese plate, served with delicious toast points.

You can visit their website and see the calendar of rotating chefs and musicians.",tensor(1),"tensor([1], device='cuda:0')"
"I haz mad love for this place which is absolutely the GO TO place if you fancy yourself a mixologist. Or an alcoholic. And even if you aren't an alcoholic, they have so many lovely choices that you could soon be on pace to be one after talking to the super helpful staff.I had been here a few years ago and it was nowhere near the empire it is today. They have great selections of wines and liquor in a store with a relatively small footprint. I had fallen into a bad rut with my red wine habit which I was standing in front of sighing, knowing that the spark in our relationship had fizzled, but not quite being ready to break up with my go to wine. A clerk took mercy on me and suggested that if I like something that was full body but not ultra high tannins, I should try Charles Martini Cab and a Francis Ford Coppola blend. Both were amazing and sooo much better than what I had been drinking at about the same price point.I had come in with an out of state friend who was looking to get awesome whiskeys and found a better selection than Frugal McDougal's. I also picked up some new bitters for my growing bar and, don't you judge me people, some giant sippy bags of margaritas. I don't know why. They were on sale and it was pregame time of year. As I stood in the check out line looking at the oversized sippy boxes that were the equivalent of a giant glass of margarita, the checkout guy seemed to sense my doubt. He said, ""you know what these are good for?"" and I shook my head to indicate 'not really'. He then held one up to his mouth in a mock chug and said - Red lights with no cops around.It was all the wrong. So, you know. They are clearly my people.",tensor(1),"tensor([1], device='cuda:0')"

Our server, Joe is extremely attentive and friendly and makes wonderful suggestions. The General Manager, Chris, is in the dining room during service and talks with each table. He also makes a point to know your name and shake your hand. We had the pleasure of meeting Chef Drew on our last visit. Awesome young chef! I can't wait to see what he is planning for the Fall Menu!

We were a small group of 3 and tried a handful of dishes: pulled pork sliders, mac and cheese, cheddar and chorizo fries, BBQ duck wings, aside from the BBQ duck wings everything was just not god, mac and cheese was watery and lacked flavor, fries were boring, sliders were just ok. With so many other restaurants popping up in this area I doubt I""ll go back and give it a second chance. I can't say much about the drinks, I think my sister was happy with the manhattan she ordered. I got a whiskey sour, I know not very adventurous, but didn't finish it, after you've tasted a well made whiskey sour, its hard to drink any others.",tensor(0),"tensor([0], device='cuda:0')"

"I arrived at 9:40am for my 9:45 appointment. I left around 11:10. This was just a ""chat and get prescription renewal"" deal, no exam needed. After waiting almost an hour I'm called back and an older woman gets my weight and BP then starts asking questions (to fill in a computerized form) and giving me answers. Her name tag says ""Health Center Assistant II"". This means she is not a licensed provider and was out of her scope of practice to tell me what sorts of things were ""totally normal"" and ""nothing to worry about"". (I completed nursing school and one of the important parts of training is not to overstep and give patients advice you're not qualified to give. This woman was not a nurse nor a nurse practitioner.) She is also talking over me and cutting me off. At the conclusion of this little interview I'm told to go back to the waiting room and the NP will call me back shortly to see me. The nurse practitioner calls through the door, I walk into the hallway by the receptionist's desk, and she hands me 2 sheets of paper. ""Are these alright?"" I look. They're my prescriptions. I say, ""Yes."" She says, ""Then you're all set,"" and walks away. This was the extent of my ""appointment"" with the NP. She didn't even introduce herself, we never went into an exam room, there was no, ""Do you have any questions about all your lady parts that could get cancerous in your 30s?"" VERY unprofessional. I've gotten shitty service at PP offices before when it's lunch time, and I have a feeling that was the case here too. However, the office was clean and I liked the stained concrete floors and colors on the walls. 2 women were at the front desk and the non-African American one was helpful and nice to everyone I heard her speak to. (I didn't interact with the African American one and didn't hear her speak to anyone besides the other front desk person.) Adoption information is available here as well as free condoms.
