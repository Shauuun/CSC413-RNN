# CSC413-RNN

Introduction: 
The deep learning model we built is an RNN with self-attention mechanism that is used for text classification. The task being solved is to classify the reviews which are inputs, into a set of categories. The input is a sequence of words represented as word embeddings, and the output is a probability distribution over the categories. In the model, we used an LSTM to learn sequential dependencies in the input text with a self-attention mechanism to weigh the importance of each word in the input sequence. The output is generated by passing the final hidden state of the LSTM through two fully connected layers with ReLU activation. Then, a final softmax layer is used to obtain the category probabilities.
